UCrBICYM0yM,the idea of the movie is great but what about Birds insects rain animals in general and aren't you going to die from hypothermia if you're outside in the winter hopefully they explain some of this otherwise great idea,0,0
UCrBICYM0yM,"How can people be excited about this crap? This makes absolutelly NO sense at all. First: Most catastrophes are not caused by overpopulation, but natural disasters. Even if you make the point of carrying capacity in terms of food becoming a problem, it could be tackled by GMOs easier and better. Second: You CAN NOT just shrink people down like this. The size of nucleons are unalterable, because the ranges of the strong and weak nuclear forces are fundamental constants. Reducing the space between nuclei and electrons is impossible because of electromagnetism. And even packing molecules tighter together wouldn't work, as there'd be biochemical problems. Correct protein folding and therefore enzymes would be rendered impossible. Third: How could they metabolize food and drinks not their own size? Their tiny enzymes wouldn't work on normal-sized molecules. I'd say if you can alter the fundamental universal constants, carrying capacity is no worry any longer, you're basically beyond even a kardashev III civilization by then. \n\nThis isn't even original, as some say. The shrinking trope has been done to death!\nAnd before someone points out this is supposed to be a comedy: Even a comedy needs suspension of disbelief. Also, it may be because I hate Hollywood comedy to the death, but at least for me they're always the same. Clichee-filled crude humor fests with plots of idiocy. And this looks exactly like that.",0,0

I saw it opening day and enjoyed so much more than I expected so I've wanted to talk about it a lot more, and you talking about it makes it feel like a conversation with a good friend ^_^\nAfter thinking about it, I theorize that Pennywise is either unable to hurt/kill a child unless they are afraid (or maybe they're just tastier when he's built up fear in them, like fear is the marinade and the longer they soak in it, the more satisfying, because I mean, he attacked Georgie no problem, but maybe he was like ehhh needs more fear) oooorrrr he's just a total egomaniac like most villains and decides that his prey must acknowledge how frightening he is to boost his self esteem or idk, maybe he wasn't hugged enough as a wee alien monster clownie.",0,0

Not to go all in the book, but in the book they plan the EFF out of their first assault on it. With weapons, even!",0,0
bp6uJJJMaLs,"it was said in an effort to let richie know that he went too far. As far as the origin of it, at the time that part of the novel was set, shows featuring comedians and variety shows were very poular.

The first part of the novel takes place in 1957, decades before the whole ironic creepy clown trope was a thing. Although creepy clowns have always been around, it wasn't as prevelant back then. A clown was still a credible disguise. \nBy moving the setting up 30 years, you make Pennywise's modus operendi rather dubious. Not to mention the fact that Bill Skarsgard didn't even try to appear anything other than a creepy monster.",0,0

Let us look at the describtion:\n>>Nihilism (/Ààna…™.…™l…™z…ôm/ or /ÀàniÀê.…™l…™z…ôm/; from the Latin nihil, nothing) is a philosophical doctrine that suggests the lack of belief in one or more reputedly meaningful aspects of life. Most commonly, nihilism is presented in the form of existential nihilism, which argues that life is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value.[1] Moral nihilists assert that there is no inherent morality, and that accepted moral values are abstractly contrived. Nihilism may also take epistemological, ontological, or metaphysical forms, meaning respectively that, in some aspect, knowledge is not possible, or reality does not actually exist.<<\n\nImagine if you had a relatively normal human being, with access to infinite time lines of infinite universes with infinite possibilities while also being one of the smartest beeings in the universe - Rick often displays something, that could be seen as almost limitless knowledge. He is simply a character that has no limitations and is aware of it. A Narcissistic personality is a disorder which manifests itself already in a very young age.

Franco's inflections and mannerism (from this admittedly short preview) are at times very Wiseau-like while others seem so far removed from Tommy it is off-putting. However, I am usually skeptical regarding things I am very fond of, so I am still excited despite my concerns.\n\nI will say I am more excited for Best F(r)iends and the possible small part Tommy plays in this movie. üòâ",0,0

bp6uJJJMaLs,"From this movie, I learned that Pennywise was an actual clown that died in a previous Derry incident. \nIT probably just finds this form more universally fear inducing than the other forms he uses. \nI expect when he lets people get away it's because he wants to let the fear simmer for a bit. \nAlso the key to defeating him is friendship, like most of life's problems. \nhttps://pics.me.me/doubt-2-youre-right-i-cant-do-it-you-cant-20047874.png\nStephen King's IT: Friendship is Magic.",0,0

bp6uJJJMaLs,"I was with It, more or less, right up to the point where the kids locate the house and decide to wander in and tackle the supernatural killer monster with, uh... friendship? Stern disapproval? I guess they thought they'd prove it was real by having it tear them all to shreds. I found it tough to y'know, BUY IN after that point. Not to go all in the book, but in the book they plan the EFF out of their first assault on it. With weapons, even!",0,0
bp6uJJJMaLs,"it was said in an effort to let richie know that he went too far. As far as the origin of it, at the time that part of the novel was set, shows featuring comedians and variety shows were very poular. At the end of the comedian's jokes, they would beep a horn, similar to the 'drumroll' that we associate with the end of jokes on modern stand up comedy routines. So the beep beep richie part was basically saying, Ok richie, joke's over!",0,0
bp6uJJJMaLs,"I love your analyses, but damnit don't ruin IT for me with your logic lol",0,0
bp6uJJJMaLs,"In the book, the whole point of Pennywise in his clown guise was to lure kids in by appearing harmless fun and goofy. The first part of the novel takes place in 1957, decades before the whole ironic creepy clown trope was a thing. Although creepy clowns have always been around, it wasn't as prevelant back then. A clown was still a credible disguise. \nBy moving the setting up 30 years, you make Pennywise's modus operendi rather dubious. Not to mention the fact that Bill Skarsgard didn't even try to appear anything other than a creepy monster.",0,0
bp6uJJJMaLs,There really was no rhyme or reason to his tactics. The only consistency was him ending a scene as a clown.,0,0
bp6uJJJMaLs,YES Jenny I'm so glad you made a video about this,0,0
bp6uJJJMaLs,I don't think it was pennywise but the actor who had never seen or heard of clowns before accepting the role. Thanks in part to the 1990s big tobacco cases that banned phillip morris from promoting clowns to children and the truth about clowns campaign.,0,0

bp6uJJJMaLs,"YES! My biggest problem with most horror movies is how illogically the murderers behave. Why would you toy with your victims in a way that implies there is an audience watching?

I saw it opening day and enjoyed so much more than I expected so I've wanted to talk about it a lot more, and you talking about it makes it feel like a conversation with a good friend ^_^\nAfter thinking about it, I theorize that Pennywise is either unable to hurt/kill a child unless they are afraid (or maybe they're just tastier when he's built up fear in them, like fear is the marinade and the longer they soak in it, the more satisfying, because I mean, he attacked Georgie no problem, but maybe he was like ehhh needs more fear) oooorrrr he's just a total egomaniac like most villains and decides that his prey must acknowledge how frightening he is to boost his self esteem or idk, maybe he wasn't hugged enough as a wee alien monster clownie.",0,0
bp6uJJJMaLs,You know nothing of It beep beep Richie is what they say to Richie to shut up. He feeds on fear. And he likes scared children he says they taste better scared. He wants to scare them to eat them but he made a mistake of letting them live longer he thaught he could eat scare them more so that they would taste better,0,0

bp6uJJJMaLs,"I've always felt that the deadites from the Evil Dead franchise feed off of fear as well, that to them it's a kind of art. Sometimes killing people is necessary for creating that fear, but if you watch enough Evil Dead stuff you start to realize that they take relatively few opportunities to actually kill.\n\nOff-topic, but whatever. I'm drunk.",0,0
bp6uJJJMaLs,"Mostly true lol, but for the first one he wasn't trying to catch him, he was trying to scare him because to him the more afraid they are the better they taste. That's also why he takes his time since hes trying to build up how scared they are. Funny video though",0,0

Most commonly, nihilism is presented in the form of existential nihilism, which argues that life is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value.[1] Moral nihilists assert that there is no inherent morality, and that accepted moral values are abstractly contrived. Nihilism may also take epistemological, ontological, or metaphysical forms, meaning respectively that, in some aspect, knowledge is not possible, or reality does not actually exist.<<\n\nImagine if you had a relatively normal human being, with access to infinite time lines of infinite universes with infinite possibilities while also being one of the smartest beeings in the universe - Rick often displays something, that could be seen as almost limitless knowledge. He is simply a character that has no limitations and is aware of it. A Narcissistic personality is a disorder which manifests itself already in a very young age. Rick on the other hand, simply decided to not give a shit.\n\nI like one theory that states that RIck is simply a character - the only character- that knows that he is actually a cartoon character.

What damages the racist ideology more is Asians do very well in America, so do the Latinos, Arabians, and Indians Three of the races fought brutal wars not to long ago with white american ancestors. The Asians fought in WW2, Korea war, and the Vietnam war which many white Americans died. But people in from those asain  countries do very well even better than whites in America. Latinos have had wars with Americans, so have the Arabians. How are these three races dealing with the evil white racism people in America?  How many war with Africa had the United States fought? Try to use your racism card out of that black people!\nOnly way to prove racism is to move half of million blacks from United States to Japan, India, Iran, Russia, China, Australia, Israel, and a country in Europe. Moving half a million black people from the united States back to a country in Africa would prove the racist ideology wrong.\nIf the half million black people in this nations become successful without welfare and stay out of prison than people can say the United States is a racist nation of people. But in Africa black people have lower quality of life,  and are murdered more...etc.",0,1

368_ovPsJk8,"You people must understand you have nothing to compare racism to!!!!!! If you have only cool water. The water isn't cool because you have no hot water to know the water is cool. What damages the racist ideology more is Asians do very well in America, so do the Latinos, Arabians, and Indians Three of the races fought brutal wars not to long ago with white american ancestors. The Asians fought in WW2, Korea war, and the Vietnam war which many white Americans died. But people in from those asain  countries do very well even better than whites in America. Latinos have had wars with Americans, so have the Arabians. How are these three races dealing with the evil white racism people in America?  How many war with Africa had the United States fought? Try to use your racism card out of that black people!\nOnly way to prove racism is to move half of million blacks from United States to Japan, India, Iran, Russia, China, Australia, Israel, and a country in Europe. Moving half a million black people from the united States back to a country in Africa would prove the racist ideology wrong.\nIf the half million black people in this nations become successful without welfare and stay out of prison than people can say the United States is a racist nation of people. But in Africa black people have lower quality of life,  and are murdered more...etc.",0,1

368_ovPsJk8,The first thing I noticed was how the female lead seemed like she was sexually frustrated but more on that later. Then I noticed without fail the racist imagery. They made sure to add that scene in the trailer. When the black man was standing up for his wife and he was yelled at to sit down. He did so as if the know your place rule was in effect. Now back to female lead you can clearly see that the creature would be her lover later on in the film. Coded imagery with the creature having human like body parts arms and legs etc to take unknowing viewer away from the fact of the sex with a creature/animal. This film is nothing more then propaganda promoting racism and bestiality. Typical of European Behavior and Culture!,0,0

dYstFRuPz8A,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens.

dYstFRuPz8A,These videos are clickbait and are a waste of time it's literally just a tv show not something that can be super analyzed,0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,"anyway so I love how you used the sine wave as a parallel to Rick's fluctuating behaviour because it also fits since in s1e10, close rickcounters of the rick kind, Rick draws a sine wave to symbolize his brain waves. Morty counters that. Behaviour speaking, it might be the same.\n\nDue to Morty's over exposure with Rick, he's also starting to act a bit more like Rick in a sense that he's starting to get numb with all the crap he's pulled into. Could it be that whenever Rick cares, Morty, as Rick's counterpart, would show hints that he does not. Like in s2e9, Look Who's Purging Now (?), Rick's doing all the killing and encourages Morty to do the same but when Morty gets into a rampage and Rick tries to balance out Morty's repressed anger by telling him to dial it back a little and even to the point he had to electrocute Morty to unconsciousness to shut him up. \n\nTheir relationship, though incredible unhealthy, somewhat balances each other a lot which creates a very great dynamic we can't get enough of.",0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,You're conflating basic human emotion with the Rick of Ricks. It's a cartoon. Stop trying to analyze the character and enjoy the show by taking away from it what you will. This video scratches the surface of the complexities of Rick and it makes me cringe when people like the narrator tries to frame the show through logic. So  has Rick changed?

But then what about Ariel's case... She is the daughter of Triton who is the son of Poseidon, brother of Zeus. This means that as Kronos is the first generation, Poseidon is the second, Triton is the third and Ariel, being Triton's Daughter is the FORTH.

pe3KSYqPIgo,"Little addition to the Tangled/Hercules connection: Rapunzel gets her magical hair from a flower that was created by a drop of sunlight. This flower heals people when you sing a special song. Apollo is the son of Zeus and the Olympian god of many things including the sun, music, medicine, light, and art. Rapunzel displays all of these in one way or another: the sun flower saves her life before she is even born, she heals people with her hair, she shows great musical ability despite being locked in a tower without any music/vocal lessons, her hair glows, and she's very artistic. Apollo is also involved in the Greek myth of the Hyacinth flower. Hyacinth was a mortal lover of Apollo. Apollo and Hyacinth were playing with a discus (a hard stone frisbee used in the Greek sport of the same name) when Apollo threw the discus and Hyacinth tried to catch it in an attempt to impress Apollo. Unfortunately, he was unable to catch it and he was struck in the head. The blow killed him and Apollo, grief stricken, decided to take his spirit and place it into a flower that he grew from Hyacinth's blood. This myth not only proves that Apollo can and will create new flowers, but also that he is active in the mortal world. Perhaps he decided that he didn't want Rapunzel's mother to die, so he created a healing flower from a drop of pure sunlight, a drop of his powers, that would cure her illness, and in doing so he gave Rapunzel some of his powers. I don't know it's just an idea, but I loved this episode even if I have seen some of the connections on the internet before. I saw the part about Rapunzel's powers having something to do with Hercules and my mind sparked.",1,0

dYstFRuPz8A,"Every show after a few seasons has their characters change.\n\nWriters always take a few seasons to figure out what the characters are ultimately going to be by the end of their run. Watch any show and compare the characters with how they were in the first two seasons to how they were midway through the show's run to the end.\n\nThough this is different from older sitcommy shows since now shows are serialized and ongoing in writing, than stand-alone shows that don't build on a continuous narrative or a growth in characters. So it is more reasonable that he is intentionally changed to show growth.",0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,"Rick may not care what other people think but he certainly cares about what his daughter thinks about him. Throughout all of his travels, Rick returns to some version of Beth. He strives for a life with at least some part of her. In the Cronenberg episode, Rick could have gone to any concieveable universe to run away but he chose to go to one where everything is pretty much the same.\nIn the season 2 finale, Rick could have run away on his own or kept living on the run with his family but chooses to turn himself in so he can topple the Galactic Federation and return to the way things were.\nAnd in the Pickle Rick episode, Rick has avoided Beth all day but after Jaguar advises Rick to spend time with his daughter while he can, Rick actually swallows his pride and attends and participates in a family therapy session. This is also one of the few truly happy endings ever seen in an episode.",0,0

dYstFRuPz8A,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewers head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. üòÇ And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

dYstFRuPz8A,Morty has changed a ton this season. He is becoming more like Rick.,3,0
dYstFRuPz8A,"I have definitely noticed a slight change in how Rick treats Morty than how he used to treat him in the previous seasons. He used to treat Morty with absolute distain but kept him around because he was a sort of cloaking device for Rick. But over the seasons, I've noticed that Rick is showing more care towards Morty and even the rest of the family, even though he tries his hardest to make them believe he's just using them for something when he saves them or he just didn't feel like having one of his grandkids die. I once heard a quote from a certain tv series that goes, When people see good, they expect good, and I don't want to have to live up to anybody's expectations. I feel like Rick actually does want to show more care towards his family, but his rude and demeaning nature would just butt in unannounced and hurt his family more, than if he just was cold and demeaning 24/7. That's just a theory, but let me ask this one question: why would Rick show any moments of concern to his family or anyone if he truly didn't care about anyone or anything? Why would he even care to act like a loving grandpa who loves his grandkids sometimes instead of just treating them unkindly and calling them names like normal? Wouldn't that be easier for him? There's also the theory that since he's lonely, he just wants company and is manipulating Summer and Morty to come with him on adventures. But he could just have Noob Noob , Mr.PoopyButthole, or any other creature come with him on his adventures...so that's something to think about.",0,0

dYstFRuPz8A,"HoooWeeeeee, clever analytic, but, with some of that (imo) you are wrong !... But i like to point out something interesting that makes the show greatly different (apart from its brilliant creativity) from other ani's like family guy, simpsons & american dad, that are stuffed with gross evil psy that without doubt can induce idiocy in real people as viewing fans emulate the psy & powerful personas, mainly due to the shows/ characters proven popularity's. So to explain this i ask: Who wants be like & do the things of the characters in Rick & Morty ? I''m sure very few will but also i'm sure that many real men can admit to allowing themselves consciously to be 'a bit Peter' on occasions, that also likely proved to be detrimental upon their real personas (speaking from experience). So with R&M all we want  to do is recite the funny catch phrases & continue to be entertained by its bizarre psy fantasy & great art. After watching R&M several times now iv'e come to the opinion that the show has some sort of 'inverted goodness' about it, on occasions in its story lines, such as the Unity story where the kids show disgust (rightly so) at the stinky post orgy, drunk grampa who obviously lost touch with all morality, who then eventually realizes his gross perversion, hanging his head in shame, alone with his self disgust (rightly so)...\nAdditional note: whilst (imo) family guy, simpsons are mostly seriously failing to be funny, american dad,s recent seasons seem to excelling with creative stories & funnies (but of course still have somewhat evil content).",0,0

dYstFRuPz8A,"Every show after a few seasons has their characters change.\n\nWriters always take a few seasons to figure out what the characters are ultimately going to be by the end of their run. Watch any show and compare the characters with how they were in the first two seasons to how they were midway through the show's run to the end.\n\nThough this is different from older sitcommy shows since now shows are serialized and ongoing in writing, than stand-alone shows that don't build on a continuous narrative or a growth in characters. So it is more reasonable that he is intentionally changed to show growth.",0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,"Rick may not care what other people think but he certainly cares about what his daughter thinks about him. Throughout all of his travels, Rick returns to some version of Beth. He strives for a life with at least some part of her. In the Cronenberg episode, Rick could have gone to any concieveable universe to run away but he chose to go to one where everything is pretty much the same.\nIn the season 2 finale, Rick could have run away on his own or kept living on the run with his family but chooses to turn himself in so he can topple the Galactic Federation and return to the way things were.\nAnd in the Pickle Rick episode, Rick has avoided Beth all day but after Jaguar advises Rick to spend time with his daughter while he can, Rick actually swallows his pride and attends and participates in a family therapy session. This is also one of the few truly happy endings ever seen in an episode.",0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,"The new writers are changing Rick in Season 3, he was the same old rick in the April fools episode but he's become completely different after. I feel in the minority that I don't like season 3 so far, its different in so many bad ways.",0,0

dYstFRuPz8A,"*The beginning of the end for Rick was the (burp) portal gun. This gave him two reali(burp)zations. A- There is an infinite number of Earth's with a never ending supply of Morty's, Beth's and so on. 2- Even though there are infinite (burp) realities, he knows (burp) he'll never get back to HIS original reality where his wife is not just a replacement from Guatelawhothehellcares. These two things in my opinion, have completely des(buuuurrpp)troyed his compassion and value for life. Much the same way we value a fudgicle.  If you drop it.. there's another one in the fridge. Hence the conflicting emotions. PICKLE RIIIIICK!!*",1,0

Eef-1HLKgoQ,"I guess not many people in the comment section liked this movie. :/ I adored it. Not because of women empowerment or whatever you wanna call it. I'm a female, but I'm for human empowerment. Gender doesn't matter when confidence is the topic. I loved the movie because I felt it's exactly how a great superhero movie should look like. To me, it felt balanced, with intrigue, drama, comedy, action, and relatability. The women who are complaining about WW not being relatable simply because she's a goddess are missing the point. We can ALL relate to her compassion, kindness, strong will, the desire to help others in need, her curious nature, her inquisitiveness, her desire for knowledge, etc. All superheros were created to, not only be a beacon of hope, but also to have characteristics and desires that we, as humans, can strive for. Except for Batman, cuz he's quite a downer. Don't be like Batman, aside from the billionaire part. :P \n\nAlso, good god, that WW main theme! <333 That one is definitely going in the top 5 list of my fave superhero themes.

Eef-1HLKgoQ,"Upvote for the reminder that Germans weren't the ultimate evil in WWI. But about the next sentences, they get kinda explained in the movie. Didn't Diana lose all her hope in mankind and was mourning about the death of her favourite human (maybe because she felt guilty of it)? So when the next world war broke out, she was probably still convinced, that humans are garbage that needs to be cleansed, while she used her time to look for love again/ mourne more, or maybe she was looking for the real reason for the war again, like an Ares behind all of it. So she missed the next wars. Until someone convinced her, that she has to act again, to defeat not a huge enemy army full of poor people, but an actual monster in not a horrible war, but one single battle. She was always wobbling between the possibilities that humans are either cruel war-loving creatures, or poor controlled victims, which maybe makes her decision not to save them or not to fight them somehow explainable.",0,0

dYstFRuPz8A,"Who thinks about this? Just watch the show, stop looking for something in it.",0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,i think it's because Rick actually did lose his original family. Which he actually stayed with as they grew. He really does care but he can't let himself care because of the constant pain he feels seeing the faces of people he lived with but aren't them anymore in his eyes.,0,0

dYstFRuPz8A,"In M.night sham-aliens there's a scene in which Rick is playing with morty while collecting the crystals. At the end of the episode it's implied that Rick knew he was in a simulation the whole time so, rick was aware that the morty he appeared to be having genuine fun with was a simulation. To me, this scene speaks to rick's character, he does want to have an emotional connection to morty but, he's too cold and detached to actually have one. I think he chose to experience the feeling of having a connection with morty within the simulation instead of the real morty.",0,0

dYstFRuPz8A,He used to be more Doc from Back to the Future.,0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,"I have definitely noticed a slight change in how Rick treats Morty than how he used to treat him in the previous seasons. He used to treat Morty with absolute distain but kept him around because he was a sort of cloaking device for Rick. But over the seasons, I've noticed that Rick is showing more care towards Morty and even the rest of the family, even though he tries his hardest to make them believe he's just using them for something when he saves them or he just didn't feel like having one of his grandkids die. I once heard a quote from a certain tv series that goes, When people see good, they expect good, and I don't want to have to live up to anybody's expectations. I feel like Rick actually does want to show more care towards his family, but his rude and demeaning nature would just butt in unannounced and hurt his family more, than if he just was cold and demeaning 24/7. That's just a theory, but let me ask this one question: why would Rick show any moments of concern to his family or anyone if he truly didn't care about anyone or anything? Why would he even care to act like a loving grandpa who loves his grandkids sometimes instead of just treating them unkindly and calling them names like normal? Wouldn't that be easier for him? There's also the theory that since he's lonely, he just wants company and is manipulating Summer and Morty to come with him on adventures. But he could just have Noob Noob , Mr.PoopyButthole, or any other creature come with him on his adventures...so that's something to think about.",0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,It was originally going to be called doc and Marty.,0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,"That thing with Mortys brainwaves cancelling out Ricks doesn't have to mean his stupidity is what causes it. If it was then I think Rick would just come out and say something like it's because your an idiot Morty but he doesn't, instead he says Morty waves and since when has Rick ever cared about Mortys feelings as seen in the start of season 2 as time is literally falling apart he stops to call Summer and Morty pieces of shit. Also when Morty ask Rick and what makes them different he just dances around the question and moves on. I think there might be more to these Morty waves than Rick let on.",0,0

dYstFRuPz8A,"HoooWeeeeee, clever analytic, but, with some of that (imo) you are wrong !... But i like to point out something interesting that makes the show greatly different (apart from its brilliant creativity) from other ani's like family guy, simpsons & american dad, that are stuffed with gross evil psy that without doubt can induce idiocy in real people as viewing fans emulate the psy & powerful personas, mainly due to the shows/ characters proven popularity's. So to explain this i ask: Who wants be like & do the things of the characters in Rick & Morty ? I''m sure very few will but also i'm sure that many real men can admit to allowing themselves consciously to be 'a bit Peter' on occasions, that also likely proved to be detrimental upon their real personas (speaking from experience). So with R&M all we want  to do is recite the funny catch phrases & continue to be entertained by its bizarre psy fantasy & great art. After watching R&M several times now iv'e come to the opinion that the show has some sort of 'inverted goodness' about it, on occasions in its story lines, such as the Unity story where the kids show disgust (rightly so) at the stinky post orgy, drunk grampa who obviously lost touch with all morality, who then eventually realizes his gross perversion, hanging his head in shame, alone with his self disgust (rightly so)...\nAdditional note: whilst (imo) family guy, simpsons are mostly seriously failing to be funny, american dad,s recent seasons seem to excelling with creative stories & funnies (but of course still have somewhat evil content).",0,0

kcTdfHXdRXo,"(((Homosexuality is an abomination before a Holy God. If they dont repent and stop doing this sinful act they will not inherit the kingdom of God. Are they going to be lovers of their flesh more then lovers of their God/Creator??? And here is the scriptural Proff in the scriptures)))...  \nThen the Lord said, The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sins so grievous that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me, if not, I will know. (Genesis 18:20-21). Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom-Both young and old-surrounded the house. They called to lot, Where are the men, (Two Angels), who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them. (Genesis 19:4-5). Get out of our way, They replied. And they said, This fellow, (Angels), came here as alien, and now they want to play the judge we'll treat you worse than them.  They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. But the men/Angels inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. Then the Men/Angels struck the men who were at the door of the house young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. (Genesis 19:9-11). The Angels said to Lot, Get your relatives out of here, Because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it. (Genesis 19:12-13).\n\nDo not lie with a man as one lies with a women; it is an abomination. (Leviticus 18:22). If a man lies with a man as one lies with a women, both of them have committed an abomination. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. (Leviticus 20:13). A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear women's clothing, for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God. (Deuteronomy 22:5). There were even Sodomites in the land; The people engaged in all the abomination practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites. (1 Kings 14:24).\n\n Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father David had done. He expelled the Sodomites from the land and got rid of all the idols his fathers had made. (1 Kings 15:11-12). He rid the land of the rest of the Sodomites who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa. (1 Kings 22:46). He also tore down the quarters of the Sodomites that were by the house of the Lord and where women did weaving for Asherah. (2 Kings 23:7). No one who has been emasculated/castrated by cutting or crushing the male sex organ may enter the assembly of the Lord. (Deuteronomy 23:1).\n\nGod gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. (Romans 1:26-27). (Homosexual/Sodomite sympathizers), although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things, but also approve of those who practice them. (Romans 1:32). Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the fornicators, nor idolaters nor adulterers nor Homosexual/Effeminate/Sodomites nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). That the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murders of fathers and mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for Sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine. ( 1 Timothy 1:9-10). Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to fornication and going after strange flesh, (Homosexual/Sodomites). They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. (Jude 7). Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from fleshly desires, which war against your souls. (1 Peter 2:11).\n\n Everyone that is Proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord: though they join forces, none will go unpunished. (Proverbs 16:5). Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. (Proverbs 16:18). To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13). He (God) beholdeth all high things: He (Satan) is a king over all the children of pride. (Job 41:34). God opposed the Proud but gives grace to the humble. (James 4:6).\n\nThe look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it, Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves. (Isaiah 3:9). God is just: He will pay back to those who trouble you, and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when The Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful Angel punishing those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out of the presence of the Lord. (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9). Call on to Jesus for forgiveness and He will set you free and be your God. Jesus said: Unless you are born again, (With the Holy spirit), you cannot enter the Kingdom of God. (John 3:3).\n\nJesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Parish. (Luke 13:3). Don't you know that you yourself are Gods temple and that God spirit lives in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy them; For Gods temple is sacred, and you are that temple. (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). So if the Sodomite commit, or anyone by that matter commit suicide and not repent of their sins. Jesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Perish. (Luke 13:3).\n\nThey will be cast into outer darkness. Where there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, where the worm never dies and the fire is never quenched. Jesus said in, (Luke 13:28), (Matthew 13:42), (Matthew 25:29-30), (Matthew 8:12), (Matthew 22:13), (Mark 9:48).\n\nSee Jesus always talked about Hell, but people never wanted to talk or hear about it. Always love love love. But people are going to find out about Gods wrath the hard way if they keep going to these false ministers and living in Sin.\n\nJesus said: Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the son of man. (Luke 6:22). Jesus said: Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false Prophets. (Luke 6:26). Jesus said: If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. (John 15:18). Jesus said: If you belong to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world that is why the world hates you. (John 15:19).\n\nAm I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. (Galatians 1:10).\n\nJesus said: the world does not hate you, but It hates me because I testify its works are evil. (John 7:7).\nJesus said: Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away, the comforter/Holy spirit will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will send him unto you, and when he comes, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of Judgment: of sin, because they believe not on me. (John 16:7).\n\nTopheth ,(Hell), has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king (Satan). Its fire pit has been made deep and wide with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze. (Isaiah 30:33).  \n\nJesus said: Then he will say to those on his left. Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels. (Matthew 25:41).\n\nThis is not a hate speech, this is love speech. Please don't trample on the Blood of Jesus. He wants to save you and set you free. I love each and every one of you, just like Jesus did on the cross for you and me.",0,0

In truth, someone huge like Brienne would defeat someone tiny like Arya quite easily for the most part. Unfortunately, GOT has a habit of ditching realism for the sake of wishful thinking quite often, as it does when Jon Snow mows effortlessly through dozens of attacking soldiers at the Battle of the Bastards, or when Brienne and Podrick defeat Stannis's soldiers though greatly outnumbered.",0,0

dYstFRuPz8A,"yeah, it's called charecter development",0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,"I really relate to Rick Sanchez from Rick and Morty. I‚Äôm nowhere near that intelligent - he‚Äôs an impossibly smart supergenius, so nobody is, and anyone who says otherwise is lying, especially if they‚Äôre saying they‚Äôre that intelligent. \n\nBut I do understand the depression that comes from being more intelligent than the majority of people in the world. You know things could be so much better if people could just see what you see and know what you know. And because you know things could be better, every sign that things are not getting better (or are getting worse) hurts your heart and makes getting through the day a Sisyphean slog. So you shut down your ability to care in order to survive, but it keeps popping back up no matter how hard you try to shove it down.\n\nI have a theory about Rick, that‚Äôs based on the fact I know something of the way he feels. My theory is that he DOES care, he just pretends he doesn‚Äôt, and often acts like he doesn‚Äôt, because the sheer psychological weight of how much he cares makes him suicidal and homicidal. There are little signs here and there in the series that he really does care, like how he keeps rescuing Morty, how he took down the intergalactic government (the act of someone who believes the world will be better off without it), some of the mind probe scenes from the first Evil Morty episode, and others. I‚Äôd have to scour the series again for more evidence.",0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,Actually he hasn't changed at all. It was established in season 1 that he cares about his grandkids.,0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,"these people are not woke enough about rick and morty. Rick at the beginning of season 1 is rick from different dimension than that of the rick that we are currently seeing. the rick we are currently seeing is the rickest rick, he's a rogue rick, cares ab his grandchildren. but he's still fucking crazy and toxic as any of the many ricks. the rick from now, and the rick from the beginning, are literally not the same person because they are from two different dimension. it's just a different version of rick.. he hasn't actually changed. I think the creators are just showing us a lot more about rick as they continue to develop his character, but it is not about rick changing and become a caring guy c'mon, cliche much ??? It's about toxic relationships and nihilism and rick's truth be exposed. pay attention the the details read between the lines and you see this so easy. the writers are smart as fuck and they gotta be doing acid o some shit lol",0,0

dYstFRuPz8A,"So far season 3 has been a major disappointment except the Evil Morty episode, but other than that the whole thing has been a train wreck. It only made me hate Rick's family even more and more and rick himself too. How fucked up a family can be? S1 and S2 showed togetherness and family bonds, but not this season. It only showed that every family member is one giant arsehole to each other. Beth have daddy issues, Summer has typical teenage issues, Morty has become cold hearted and Rick is the most changed person out of all. I have lost the count as for how many times he has basically left his family members to die or rot for his own selfishness.",0,0

dYstFRuPz8A,"Technically, unity is just a disease. It is kinda genderless.",0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,"In the Vindicators episode, sober Rick is the one to point out the possibility that drunk Rick was doing these things because he cares about Morty. I get all emotional when I'm drunk. So he's acknowledging and admitting, even if drunk Rick  doesn't think that way, it doesn't mean he doesn't care as a whole. In fact, I think it means MORE that he admits it while sober. Rest and Ricklaxation was a pretty huge development as well, in my opinion. Pretty blatant, don't you think? The most recent episode shows a lot of caring as well, holding Morty when he is distressed, and removing painful memories to comfort him when, if you think about it, he didn't have to. (Of course, in some cases he also did it to be selfish, but that's another discussion entirely. I may make a video about it, who knows?)\nMy point is, I think season 3 is establishing that his uncaring wall is breaking down. The up and down wave is still going on, but that doesn't mean the wave isn't changing course. I hope Rick can find contentment in the end. I think we all do. It's probably going to be a really long development stretching over the whole series.",0,0

dYstFRuPz8A,"What if when Rick goes to confront the new president of The Citadel (Evil Morty), he can't kill  Evil Morty because it's a younger version of himself and is in fact his original Morty. However Evil Morty can kill Rick because it is an older version of  himself and thus it wouldn't affect him at that point. After Evil Morty Kills Rick he changes his way and eventually decides to take care of the Morty that we have seen in season three trying to be a better Rick. I know this theory is pretty off but i'm sure if you try and elaborate it could become a decent plausible theory. If this theory becomes bigger i am the first person to do it on September 20th 2017.",0,0

dYstFRuPz8A,"Rick's lack of emotions, or masking of it, is a defence mechanism. There are people in real life that do this and even I do it to a certain extent, just nowhere near as extreme... I hope. There's a term for it in psychology, but I forget the term. Apparently, if someone deduces everything to logic and tries to ignore any emotional aspect of a situation it becomes hard to counsel them and so a different strategy must be executed. I think this premise was kind of illustrated in the episode with the psychiatrist where Rick was the master of his universe, but also ironically slathered in rat blood and shit. He's a genius beyond comprehension yet he fails to realise his family is suffering and taking the brunt of his careless actions, which doesn't take a genius to realise.",0,0

To me, this scene speaks to rick's character, he does want to have an emotional connection to morty but, he's too cold and detached to actually have one. I think he chose to experience the feeling of having a connection with morty within the simulation instead of the real morty.",0,0

Also when Morty ask Rick and what makes them different he just dances around the question and moves on. I think there might be more to these Morty waves than Rick let on.",0,0

dYstFRuPz8A,"I have definitely noticed a slight change in how Rick treats Morty than how he used to treat him in the previous seasons. He used to treat Morty with absolute distain but kept him around because he was a sort of cloaking device for Rick. But over the seasons, I've noticed that Rick is showing more care towards Morty and even the rest of the family, even though he tries his hardest to make them believe he's just using them for something when he saves them or he just didn't feel like having one of his grandkids die. I once heard a quote from a certain tv series that goes, When people see good, they expect good, and I don't want to have to live up to anybody's expectations. I feel like Rick actually does want to show more care towards his family, but his rude and demeaning nature would just butt in unannounced and hurt his family more, than if he just was cold and demeaning 24/7. That's just a theory, but let me ask this one question: why would Rick show any moments of concern to his family or anyone if he truly didn't care about anyone or anything? Why would he even care to act like a loving grandpa who loves his grandkids sometimes instead of just treating them unkindly and calling them names like normal? Wouldn't that be easier for him? There's also the theory that since he's lonely, he just wants company and is manipulating Summer and Morty to come with him on adventures. But he could just have Noob Noob , Mr.PoopyButthole, or any other creature come with him on his adventures...so that's something to think about.",0,0

kcTdfHXdRXo,"(((Homosexuality is an abomination before a Holy God. If they dont repent and stop doing this sinful act they will not inherit the kingdom of God. Are they going to be lovers of their flesh more then lovers of their God/Creator??? And here is the scriptural Proff in the scriptures)))...  \nThen the Lord said, The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sins so grievous that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me, if not, I will know. (Genesis 18:20-21). Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom-Both young and old-surrounded the house. They called to lot, Where are the men, (Two Angels), who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them. (Genesis 19:4-5). Get out of our way, They replied. And they said, This fellow, (Angels), came here as alien, and now they want to play the judge we'll treat you worse than them.  They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. But the men/Angels inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. Then the Men/Angels struck the men who were at the door of the house young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. (Genesis 19:9-11). The Angels said to Lot, Get your relatives out of here, Because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it. (Genesis 19:12-13).\n\nDo not lie with a man as one lies with a women; it is an abomination. (Leviticus 18:22). If a man lies with a man as one lies with a women, both of them have committed an abomination. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. (Leviticus 20:13). A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear women's clothing, for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God. (Deuteronomy 22:5). There were even Sodomites in the land; The people engaged in all the abomination practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites. (1 Kings 14:24).\n\n Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father David had done. He expelled the Sodomites from the land and got rid of all the idols his fathers had made. (1 Kings 15:11-12). He rid the land of the rest of the Sodomites who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa. (1 Kings 22:46). He also tore down the quarters of the Sodomites that were by the house of the Lord and where women did weaving for Asherah. (2 Kings 23:7). No one who has been emasculated/castrated by cutting or crushing the male sex organ may enter the assembly of the Lord. (Deuteronomy 23:1).\n\nGod gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. (Romans 1:26-27). (Homosexual/Sodomite sympathizers), although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things, but also approve of those who practice them. (Romans 1:32). Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the fornicators, nor idolaters nor adulterers nor Homosexual/Effeminate/Sodomites nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). That the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murders of fathers and mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for Sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine. ( 1 Timothy 1:9-10). Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to fornication and going after strange flesh, (Homosexual/Sodomites). They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. (Jude 7). Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from fleshly desires, which war against your souls. (1 Peter 2:11).\n\n Everyone that is Proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord: though they join forces, none will go unpunished. (Proverbs 16:5). Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. (Proverbs 16:18). To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13). He (God) beholdeth all high things: He (Satan) is a king over all the children of pride. (Job 41:34). God opposed the Proud but gives grace to the humble. (James 4:6).\n\nThe look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it, Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves. (Isaiah 3:9). God is just: He will pay back to those who trouble you, and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when The Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful Angel punishing those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out of the presence of the Lord. (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9). Call on to Jesus for forgiveness and He will set you free and be your God. Jesus said: Unless you are born again, (With the Holy spirit), you cannot enter the Kingdom of God. (John 3:3).\n\nJesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Parish. (Luke 13:3). Don't you know that you yourself are Gods temple and that God spirit lives in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy them; For Gods temple is sacred, and you are that temple. (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). So if the Sodomite commit, or anyone by that matter commit suicide and not repent of their sins. Jesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Perish. (Luke 13:3).\n\nThey will be cast into outer darkness. Where there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, where the worm never dies and the fire is never quenched. Jesus said in, (Luke 13:28), (Matthew 13:42), (Matthew 25:29-30), (Matthew 8:12), (Matthew 22:13), (Mark 9:48).\n\nSee Jesus always talked about Hell, but people never wanted to talk or hear about it. Always love love love. But people are going to find out about Gods wrath the hard way if they keep going to these false ministers and living in Sin.\n\nJesus said: Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the son of man. (Luke 6:22). Jesus said: Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false Prophets. (Luke 6:26). Jesus said: If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. (John 15:18). Jesus said: If you belong to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world that is why the world hates you. (John 15:19).\n\nAm I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. (Galatians 1:10).\n\nJesus said: the world does not hate you, but It hates me because I testify its works are evil. (John 7:7).\nJesus said: Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away, the comforter/Holy spirit will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will send him unto you, and when he comes, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of Judgment: of sin, because they believe not on me. (John 16:7).\n\nTopheth ,(Hell), has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king (Satan). Its fire pit has been made deep and wide with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze. (Isaiah 30:33).  \n\nJesus said: Then he will say to those on his left. Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels. (Matthew 25:41).\n\nThis is not a hate speech, this is love speech. Please don't trample on the Blood of Jesus. He wants to save you and set you free. I love each and every one of you, just like Jesus did on the cross for you and me.",0,0

However skilled and quick Arya might be, Brienne's advantages in terms of strength and wingspan give her an enormous advantage in close combat. In truth, someone huge like Brienne would defeat someone tiny like Arya quite easily for the most part. Unfortunately, GOT has a habit of ditching realism for the sake of wishful thinking quite often, as it does when Jon Snow mows effortlessly through dozens of attacking soldiers at the Battle of the Bastards, or when Brienne and Podrick defeat Stannis's soldiers though greatly outnumbered.",0,0

cHbkEESIl7g,"That's crazy. I was totally impressed when I saw 0:50 in that actual episode, because I thought Maisie really did the hop back on her feet since they showed her face without cutting from a different shot. I didn't realize it was a stunt double with CG of Maisie's face added onl. It's scary what they can do with CGI these days and how realistic/unnoticeable it is.

I‚Äôm nowhere near that intelligent - he‚Äôs an impossibly smart supergenius, so nobody is, and anyone who says otherwise is lying, especially if they‚Äôre saying they‚Äôre that intelligent. \n\nBut I do understand the depression that comes from being more intelligent than the majority of people in the world. You know things could be so much better if people could just see what you see and know what you know. And because you know things could be better, every sign that things are not getting better (or are getting worse) hurts your heart and makes getting through the day a Sisyphean slog. So you shut down your ability to care in order to survive, but it keeps popping back up no matter how hard you try to shove it down.\n\nI have a theory about Rick, that‚Äôs based on the fact I know something of the way he feels. My theory is that he DOES care, he just pretends he doesn‚Äôt, and often acts like he doesn‚Äôt, because the sheer psychological weight of how much he cares makes him suicidal and homicidal. There are little signs here and there in the series that he really does care, like how he keeps rescuing Morty, how he took down the intergalactic government (the act of someone who believes the world will be better off without it), some of the mind probe scenes from the first Evil Morty episode, and others.

But then he did throw the party for Noob Noob as a contingency to keep from getting killed, however it was Morty's dismissal of him that made him get all drunk and emotional in the first place.

dYstFRuPz8A,"these people are not woke enough about rick and morty. Rick at the beginning of season 1 is rick from different dimension than that of the rick that we are currently seeing. the rick we are currently seeing is the rickest rick, he's a rogue rick, cares ab his grandchildren. but he's still fucking crazy and toxic as any of the many ricks. the rick from now, and the rick from the beginning, are literally not the same person because they are from two different dimension. it's just a different version of rick.. he hasn't actually changed. I think the creators are just showing us a lot more about rick as they continue to develop his character, but it is not about rick changing and become a caring guy c'mon, cliche much ??? It's about toxic relationships and nihilism and rick's truth be exposed. pay attention the the details read between the lines and you see this so easy. the writers are smart as fuck and they gotta be doing acid o some shit lol",0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,I fucking hate the rick and morty fanbase this video is shit itsjust explaining the obvious people eat this shit up,0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,"So far season 3 has been a major disappointment except the Evil Morty episode, but other than that the whole thing has been a train wreck. It only made me hate Rick's family even more and more and rick himself too. How fucked up a family can be? S1 and S2 showed togetherness and family bonds, but not this season. It only showed that every family member is one giant arsehole to each other. Beth have daddy issues, Summer has typical teenage issues, Morty has become cold hearted and Rick is the most changed person out of all. I have lost the count as for how many times he has basically left his family members to die or rot for his own selfishness.",0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,"Technically, unity is just a disease. It is kinda genderless.",0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,"In the Vindicators episode, sober Rick is the one to point out the possibility that drunk Rick was doing these things because he cares about Morty. I get all emotional when I'm drunk. So he's acknowledging and admitting, even if drunk Rick  doesn't think that way, it doesn't mean he doesn't care as a whole. In fact, I think it means MORE that he admits it while sober. Rest and Ricklaxation was a pretty huge development as well, in my opinion. Pretty blatant, don't you think? The most recent episode shows a lot of caring as well, holding Morty when he is distressed, and removing painful memories to comfort him when, if you think about it, he didn't have to. (Of course, in some cases he also did it to be selfish, but that's another discussion entirely. I may make a video about it, who knows?)\nMy point is, I think season 3 is establishing that his uncaring wall is breaking down. The up and down wave is still going on, but that doesn't mean the wave isn't changing course. I hope Rick can find contentment in the end. I think we all do. It's probably going to be a really long development stretching over the whole series.",0,0

3fILUAGw2mE,"Some say that Albert Einstein believed in a creator or Intelligent design. It is unconfirmed about which religion he most supported or if he believed in something else all together. But I will say that I am a Christian and a Philosopher. (Which if you didn't know already is the origin of science and government.) \n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† \n¬†I know that you are believer in science, so I also expect you to be either agnostic or atheist. If you are an atheist, then according to my understanding of the word: there is nothing I can do to convince you of God's existence. If you are an agnostic, then according to my understanding of the word, you are a true skeptic. \n\n(I define atheist as someone who rejects the concept of God and an agnostic as someone who doubts the concept of God. I am not being judgmental or presuming anything. I just define them this way so that I can distinguish between the two.) \n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†\n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† And if you are a man of science, then you must understand and accept an important philosophy: You have to look at all the facts for both sides of an argument before making your decision about who is more accurate. (And according to my Physics teacher, Nothing is science is ever proven. There is just evidence that supports an idea.)\n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†\n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† If you support this philosophy, then you must consider yourself agnostic rather than an atheist. If this is true about you, then I can give you links to evidence for God's existence, discussions about biblical topics, and even a testimony about an atheist who became a Christian. Once you have learned this knowledge, you can make up you mind afterwards.\n\n(THE FOLLOWING IS ADDRESSED TO EVERYONE. I INVITE EVERYONE TO READ THE FOLLOWING AND REPLY ACCORDING TO WHAT IS BELOW)\n\nI will not be posting the links on this comment. I will also not be posting it as a reply to it. Instead, I will be posting them elsewhere. Read the following to find out where.\n\nIf you claim to be an atheist even after seeing my definition of it, reply to my comment.\n\nIf you claim to be an agnostic based on my definition of it, do not reply to my comment. Instead, go to my channel, click on any video, and say this in the comments: Alpha and Omega. ¬†If you do this, I will provide you with the links.\n\nIf you are a Christian, or claim to be one (since there are false and half-hearted Christians), do not get involved if anyone starts arguing with me. Instead, reply with these words: GODS NOT DEAD. If you want to see a testimony or grow in your understanding, post this as a comment on any of my videos on my channel.\n\nIf you are a Jew or Muslim, I also invite you to see the links. While I do not doubt your belief in God, I do ask these questions. To Muslims, Is Allah really ¬†the same God as the one Jews and Christians believe in; and do you really understand what Muhammad really teaches? To Jews: Why do you reject Jesus as the Messiah? Do you reject him because that is what you were taught, or did you choose to reject him after researching what Christians believe.¬†For Muslims, go to my channel and comment the word: ALLAH If you are a Jew, go to my channel and comment this phrase on any of my videos: The Books of Moses.¬†\n\nIf you are part of another Religion, I will ask you this. Do you believe out of tradition? Do You believe because you chose to? Do you believe half-heartedly? Or are you devoted to your beliefs? Regardless of what the answer is, I can ¬†tell you that only the one who is devoted will remain after I provide evidence. If you have any doubts about your beliefs or yourself, comment this on any of my videos: John 3:16\n\nFor members of a cult, I have nothing to say accept this. Time is running out.

3fILUAGw2mE,"This theory is solid, but it doesn't go far enough. Lust's Alchemy Stone is made entirely from a 1 14th component to a human soul, lust. So it stands to reason that she only has the average value from a 1 14th part that is used as a full part. What I mean to say is that Lust doesn't have the full value of a soul because she lacks 13 parts of the 14 part total. Also in FMA they explicitly state that you cannot bring somebody back form the dead because each soul is unique and worth a value of immeasurable energy. Thus it also stands to reason that the compound effect of a full 14 part soul is literal infinite energy. So I devise that the more completed a soul is the more exponential it's energy output can be. I also note that every individuals' ratios of vices and virtues would differ making Lust a combination of the average lust on the 539,000 souls used. This is the plight of splitting a soul. Dumbledore wisely stated that splitting a soul is the result of never examining the value of an intact soul, I'd say the statement stands true in this theory. Enjoyed the video though.",0,0

Envy's real body is huge and took more attacks from Mustang.¬†\n3. Half her weight? Does that include her clothes? Are you sure only half her body is burned each time? What about the first time Mustang attacked her with the water from the pipes?\n4. Wrath's stone gave him the ultimate eye, or did it? I don't know if it's mentioned in the anime or not if they stones give homunculi their abilities or if thats the result of taking that aspect from someone's personality.

Before that, Mustang also shot her a few times, and she opened up her own chest to reveal the philosopher's stone. After that, Mustang tried to rip her stone out. Her body decomposed and she regenerated a new one from a single blood vessel. Even before that, Maes Hughes stabbed her in the forehead.

3fILUAGw2mE,"When he burns lust, he isn't destroying her atoms itself though. That would require he use the equal energy of 19 hydrogen bombs just to destroy her. And he didn't have a philosophers stone. What he was doing is breaking bonds within lust's molecules. Her mass is conserved, it isn't being broken down into pure energy. So you would have to calculate the energy needed to break the molecular bonds within lust, water would be the highest value, as you add energy to turn water within the body to steam. Then you would have to look up other bond values for fats, tissues bone, etc. once you find the energy needed to basically cremate a human body, you multiply it by 9 for every time he incinerates her, then you have the correct energy value. Matpat's logic was that when he burns lust, he destroys the very atom itself turning it into a slew of protons, neutrons, and electrons and energy. values to break apart the atom itself is extremely high, which is where the big numbers come into play, the Hiroshima bomb only successfully destroyed .7g of atoms of uranium out its 7kg uranium payload. That little mass released a huge amount of energy, however not enough to fully release its maximum potential energy. Bottom line, there would be no way he could safely nor effectively transfer that amount of energy to destroy lust in such a way.",0,0

kcTdfHXdRXo,"(((Homosexuality is an abomination before a Holy God. If they dont repent and stop doing this sinful act they will not inherit the kingdom of God. Are they going to be lovers of their flesh more then lovers of their God/Creator??? And here is the scriptural Proff in the scriptures)))...  \nThen the Lord said, The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sins so grievous that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me, if not, I will know. (Genesis 18:20-21). Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom-Both young and old-surrounded the house. They called to lot, Where are the men, (Two Angels), who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them. (Genesis 19:4-5). Get out of our way, They replied. And they said, This fellow, (Angels), came here as alien, and now they want to play the judge we'll treat you worse than them.  They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. But the men/Angels inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. Then the Men/Angels struck the men who were at the door of the house young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. (Genesis 19:9-11). The Angels said to Lot, Get your relatives out of here, Because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it. (Genesis 19:12-13).\n\nDo not lie with a man as one lies with a women; it is an abomination. (Leviticus 18:22). If a man lies with a man as one lies with a women, both of them have committed an abomination. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. (Leviticus 20:13). A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear women's clothing, for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God. (Deuteronomy 22:5). There were even Sodomites in the land; The people engaged in all the abomination practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites. (1 Kings 14:24).\n\n Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father David had done. He expelled the Sodomites from the land and got rid of all the idols his fathers had made. (1 Kings 15:11-12). He rid the land of the rest of the Sodomites who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa. (1 Kings 22:46). He also tore down the quarters of the Sodomites that were by the house of the Lord and where women did weaving for Asherah. (2 Kings 23:7). No one who has been emasculated/castrated by cutting or crushing the male sex organ may enter the assembly of the Lord. (Deuteronomy 23:1).\n\nGod gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. (Romans 1:26-27). (Homosexual/Sodomite sympathizers), although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things, but also approve of those who practice them. (Romans 1:32). Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the fornicators, nor idolaters nor adulterers nor Homosexual/Effeminate/Sodomites nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). That the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murders of fathers and mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for Sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine. ( 1 Timothy 1:9-10). Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to fornication and going after strange flesh, (Homosexual/Sodomites). They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. (Jude 7). Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from fleshly desires, which war against your souls. (1 Peter 2:11).\n\n Everyone that is Proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord: though they join forces, none will go unpunished. (Proverbs 16:5). Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. (Proverbs 16:18). To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13). He (God) beholdeth all high things: He (Satan) is a king over all the children of pride. (Job 41:34). God opposed the Proud but gives grace to the humble. (James 4:6).\n\nThe look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it, Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves. (Isaiah 3:9). God is just: He will pay back to those who trouble you, and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when The Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful Angel punishing those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out of the presence of the Lord. (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9). Call on to Jesus for forgiveness and He will set you free and be your God. Jesus said: Unless you are born again, (With the Holy spirit), you cannot enter the Kingdom of God. (John 3:3).\n\nJesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Parish. (Luke 13:3). Don't you know that you yourself are Gods temple and that God spirit lives in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy them; For Gods temple is sacred, and you are that temple. (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). So if the Sodomite commit, or anyone by that matter commit suicide and not repent of their sins. Jesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Perish. (Luke 13:3).\n\nThey will be cast into outer darkness. Where there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, where the worm never dies and the fire is never quenched. Jesus said in, (Luke 13:28), (Matthew 13:42), (Matthew 25:29-30), (Matthew 8:12), (Matthew 22:13), (Mark 9:48).\n\nSee Jesus always talked about Hell, but people never wanted to talk or hear about it. Always love love love. But people are going to find out about Gods wrath the hard way if they keep going to these false ministers and living in Sin.\n\nJesus said: Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the son of man. (Luke 6:22). Jesus said: Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false Prophets. (Luke 6:26). Jesus said: If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. (John 15:18). Jesus said: If you belong to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world that is why the world hates you. (John 15:19).\n\nAm I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. (Galatians 1:10).\n\nJesus said: the world does not hate you, but It hates me because I testify its works are evil. (John 7:7).\nJesus said: Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away, the comforter/Holy spirit will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will send him unto you, and when he comes, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of Judgment: of sin, because they believe not on me. (John 16:7).\n\nTopheth ,(Hell), has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king (Satan). Its fire pit has been made deep and wide with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze. (Isaiah 30:33).  \n\nJesus said: Then he will say to those on his left. Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels. (Matthew 25:41).\n\nThis is not a hate speech, this is love speech. Please don't trample on the Blood of Jesus. He wants to save you and set you free. I love each and every one of you, just like Jesus did on the cross for you and me.",0,0

JU21shbaVBo,The Baloo/Robin Hood shot you're looking for is around 8:00. What was the first Disney movie you saw where you thought you'd seen a shot before? What did we miss?,32,6

JU21shbaVBo,The perfect case of work smarter not harder,27,1
JU21shbaVBo,Fun Fact: All of Toy Story's 3 characters were all new 3D models.,16,0
JU21shbaVBo,"Disney barely retraced, if you compare frames you can see it was only used the film as reference, not rotoscoping... 2 extremely different things.\nReference is still used today in 3D animation, just as used in Alice in Wonderland.",9,0
JU21shbaVBo,13:00 Oh yeah!!,10,0
JU21shbaVBo,"As a professional cgi modeller,  I have to say, it is a lot harder to reuse a model than it sounds. \n\nFor one thing, each production has a different style so things aren't likely to fit without edits. Productions can also be at different scales, or built for characters with different proportions. Your tall chair for a long legged character will look odd for a new short big-headed child\n\nBut the main problem is the organization. Every studio, but even every project, can have its own methods. New props need their own file folders and organizations within those folders. Each piece of the prop has certain names and groupings. Do you keep the pieces separate or weld them together? Do you instance them? Does the modeler create a uv map or is that someone else's job? How many edge loops are there? Should there be more faces and details or less? Quads or triangles?\n\nOne production I had got all the old models from another company and we had to reorganize EVERYTHING. It took AGES.\n\nOnce again, it really is easier to start from scratch\n\nEdit: Just to add to that, it would also take ages to find anything amongst old files too. Everything is named short-formed. And I didn't even mention different software and the fact that Maya alone makes a new version every year. The versions aren't compatible. My company has projects on 2013 and others on 2015",48,1
JU21shbaVBo,"The early movies you used as examples of rotoscoping are blatantly not. You can see it in the timing, how it doesn't exactly match: The live action footage was shot for REFERENCE, not to be traced. They still do that to this day, in EVERY animation studio that is worth their salt. - an irritated animator",102,7

JU21shbaVBo,"With Hana-Barbara television animation reusing assets was their trademark.  In a process very similar to how modern Flash or animation software suits work, they would draw individual assets to a cell, then layer them on top of background cells.

My mom loves shitty romance novels but I think even this is just too fucking terrible for her to read and she WILL read gods damn near anything. Thank you so much for sharing this with the world because the 'mainstream media' won't tell us that there is great 'art' like this out there. Gods this is shit. Also, Jenny, you are 100% correct. There is nothing romantic about the antagonist's actions and the protagonist's actions are inexplicable. It seems like this was written by a socially retarded 30 year old male that has never actually had a real conversation with a female or, as Jenny suggested, a mid-west, 48 year old pastor's wife and mother of 7 that's trying to remember what sex was like before her vagina became a clown car.",0,0

Now I'm clicking off... after a few more seconds...  ;-)  Then the credits were rolling.\n\nBut as an independent author, I agree that we need to be supported.  And there is another possibility for this writer.  If you've ever done some reading about Heinlein and Asimov, you would know that they, and many other important writers, also did some erotica.  To pay the bills.  And to hone their skills I think.  I hate to suggest this, but take a peak at the book again.  Other than plot and substance, how well written is it?  Grammatically?  \n\nBTW, said I was an indi author.

Blind dates are nerve racking enough without chemically induced hyperactivity to worry about. then I see you open the door to this over priced coffee chain, that shall go unnamed for trade make reasons , it seems that you didn't put much effort in dressing for this date. hair pulled back held up with a dingy grey scrunchy and an outfit I am not sure if it came from a gym bag or if they are your PJ's. you head strait to the counter to order without even glancing my way. thank god I have time to fix the over dressing I have done. I quickly remove my tie and shove in my pocket and undo the top to button of my shirt. I consider a third, but stop myself what are you trying to show off your moobs? what if those are her gym cloths? she works out, when was the last time you worked out? and runs to the store for sad frozen pizzas for one and beer for 6 don't count! I think to myself because that is how thoughts work...she comes over and with a smile introduces herself confirming that she is a friend of a friend. I can feel my heart start to race and sweat start to form on the palms of my hands . YES!! *cough* yes i am friends with... i stop to grab my inhaler. An awkward gasp later I try to apologize  for my awkward awkwardness nearly as awkward as using awkward so many time in an awkward sentence. you just chuckle a little and say,  it's ok, it's not every day I take someones breath away. I pause , i feel my nervous smile start to soften in to a genuine gin. Soooo you say as my inner monologue continues, I hear we have a lot in common, you  are a huge nerd for Star Wars too?! (someone forgot to give you to memo on trade makes). still nervous I blurt out  NAH i AM ALL ABOUT BATTLE FIELD EARTH...  Our eyes meet and in a gaze we can tell we are both sarcastic assholes. we both start to laugh at the idea that anyone could like that train wreck....we talk for hours I let the tea grow cold, as conversation just won't stop flowing from our mouths like a back out toilet at denny's  on free meal night. (TRADE MARKS BE DAMNED) then it hits us that rush that is a mix of excitement are fear, WE'VE BEEN TALKING HOW LONG!? you have to get to work and I am also a productive member of society....promise...you jump up and rush out the door after give me a shoulder hug as i sit clumsily trying to reciprocate with a one armed hug around the middle of you back. you are gone now and I get a text for the friend of a friend:  how'd it go?\nme: didn't throw up\nFOAF: so 75% better than most of your dates\nme:  that would be funnier if it wasn't mathematically accurate\nFOAF: comedy is subjective, and the facts and hilarious to me!

DKY09vZWj88,"The film and book are both undeniably visionary, but I think critics still struggle to embrace Alex as an anti-hero because of how exploitative A Clockwork Orange's violence and sexual assault seem to be. I wouldn't go so far to say that Kubrick or Burgess used this kind of hyper-violence just for shock value, but even in the novel/book's morally bankrupt world, it feels disturbing and repulsive to have someone so reprehensible not only get away with many of his crimes, but also be celebrated as the glamorous anti-hero of his story. Perhaps all of that is kind of the point, but personally for me, being in Alex's head was too uncomfortable to me, and I wanted out. \nBy the movie's end, I wouldn't go so far as ScreenPrism concludes and say that we are ultimately glad that Alex returns to his violent self, more so that we come to understand him as not being as easily villafiable in the context of the society he lives in.",0,0

At the time of reading it, I was also reading Orwell & other scifi authors who mainly wrote social commentary via dystopian future fiction. I remember the book being pretty brutal but seeing something on screen visually is always somehow different than reading about it. And sometimes artistic choices directors make to get a visual idea across can fall flat, especially when dealing with extreme violence or sexual themes.\n\nAnyways, I remember that book making me think, really think, about issues like social responsibility & ethical treatment of criminals, & just question the foundation of morality & free will itself. My recommendation would be to read the novel before seeing the film. Malcolm MacDowell is absolutely chilling as Alex.",2,0

Oh and then they show Thomas facing the villian with a gun.\nThis is the first trailer, and they created a very short, kinda boring and super spoilery trailer.

The first design basically just turned the same direction over and over, they fixed that. They improved the carts. The music that played when they first introduced the speakers on the cart reminded me of Rob Zombie Dgragular. They have probably changed that out again.

So what would the ratio of soul-energy to energy of physical matter in the human body and don't throw this off I know that the amount of matter used in those bombs is quantifiable {most likely for a recipe for destruction for amount used}\n\nI AM NOT BEING THIS WAY FOR THE HECK OF IT, when I was in elementary I choose to do a project with Einstein as my subject and as such, i think you can do better than this and send the flame/hate my way as I could use it to keep myself warm for the winter months",0,0

3fILUAGw2mE,"Love your newest FMA theory... but sorry to be nickpicky about this...At around 8:00 I remember that Father simply used some of the souls he has to cut off the energy of the tectonic plates that the Amestrian alchemists used to power their alchemy. This was to make sure he has¬†power over¬†his chosen¬†human sacrifices. Later in episode 61, Father loses this advantage thanks to Scar activating the nationwide alkehestry circle to restore the Amestrian alchemists' alchemy back to the way it should've been.For the most part, your theory is based on possible assumptions.However, you have to take into account that maybe not all of the Homunculi are created equal. It's possible that some have more souls in their philosopher stones than others. For example, Envy seems to contain a lot considering he's (or should I use it since I don't think Envy even has a definite gender?) been killed throughout the series quite a number of times and still have plenty left over even after his sacrificing some of his stone to get out of Gluttony's stomach¬†stint. But unlike Pride, who was practically half-dead from forcing Roy to perform human transmutation, Envy was relatively fine.You also haven't taken into account that they also use their stones to do the things they can, like transforming into another person, creating shadow appendages, changing¬†their body into a¬†carbon-based armor,¬†and creating long fingernail spears. Going back to Envy again, how many times have we seen Envy transform on screen? Considering it was given the¬†responsibility for keeping track of the ongoings of the country and military via infiltration, it'll probably have used up all supposed 38,309 souls by the time the series started.But anyways, sorry for the rambling.

Cause that's what he trades for to tie Al's soul to the suite of armour, and what Al trades for to bring back Ed's arm :P\n\nSo the question is, is the answer still the same when you plug in the mass of a decently healthy kid's right arm? And would it still work if you plug in the mass of a young adult's very malnourished right arm?\n\nOf course, that's only if trading with Truth is the same as normal alchemy. Also, if we're talking about how much energy a soul is worth, Ed also uses his own soul energy to heal his body. I think he says that it'll take a few years off his life, or something like that. It's been a while since I've watched, okay?\n\nGreat theory though :)\n\nEdit: for all you people complaining about how the math is off because Lust has died many more times before the Roy incident, just use this one to one ratio the anime provided for us and calculate it yourself, I'm sure the information you need is somewhere on the Internet :/",0,0

3fILUAGw2mE,"It should be noted that Lust probably had a lot less than her original amount of souls. It's unlikely that she had lived without generating a single injury.

On the same track, Lust (and the other sins) would have even less souls due to expending them for their own power. These are just a few factors I can think of but there are probably heaps more",0,0

2Lq5pZrbpHc,"I really love all the Mormonts. they all are just such likable characters. Jeor and Jorah are both men who have pasts that weigh heavy on their minds, and how they act in the present. they aren't boastful, like many other great warriors from other houses, yet they are incredible fighters. Jeor clearly has great compassion for all the members of the nights watch, even the worst of them, treating them as his own both when giving affection and support and when punishment and disappointment. I like the Show's depiction of Jorah's fighting skills, yes, he'll get hit, and he isn't the is flawless superhuman, but has a seeming inability to give up. he preservers through the hardships, through getting the shit kicked out of him, because he knows he can take more than any he faces can give, and he has the motivation to keep pushing on. Lyanna is interesting, as she's the most boastful Mormont, but not in an arrogant way. She's proud of her people, home, and family and clearly has a deep love for them. she is also one of the most if not the most capable child-ruler we've seen on the show. she doesn't let adults bully her or control her as a puppet like Jeoffrey, Tommen, and Robin Aryn.

Only the outside of the building is still reminiscent of the Jules Verne - Steampunk styling.

Consider Faith for example, if you were to take an equal amount of people from a holy city and one where religion is not a required teaching you might find the lack of faith disturbing.\n\nEven sticking with the assumption that Lust's stone had received an equal amount of souls, you are also assuming that their battery is fully charged. That obviously can't be the case with how she impales people that aggravate her, and it's doubtful that was the first time she was in danger or needed healing. \n\nFather has been shown to recreate the homunculi as well, but it is not stated if there's an equal return when he reforms them or if they get more power through their own means while out there.

After ally, Envy's true form is basically all the lives in his philosopher stone taking form around his body (or something like that). But perhaps it takes more than one soul to regenerate their entire body. My point is that maybe your calculations are a bit off since we don't know how many times Lust died in the past after being created. So we can't just assume that her philosopher stone is fully charged at the time when Lust was killed by Mustang. But still a really interesting theory nonetheless",0,0

You project a\nreally asexual vibe, but also really intimate and soft, sitting on the bed\nsurrounded by plushies, talking about star wars and such, such a fangless world\nof illusion and massive, emptying malls you seem to inhabit, Disneyland...\nAnyway, we were in a room similar to my room, with a window overlooking a\ngarden, a big window at night, and the thrill was really in playing this game\nwhere I was seducing you, but you were clearly on-board from the\nstart. There was no dumb coy aspect present, I was being very\ndirect about it, but there was humor in the air. I have to tell you my\ngirlfriend is SOFT, on a tactile level, my mind just ran those sensations when\nI slid into your mouth (it¬¥s the internet, I know it¬¥s not impressive to write\nthings like this, shut up, I¬¥m not trying to impress you). I mean, I know I\ndon¬¥t really know you, and I don¬¥t want to cheat on my girlfriend lol, I¬¥m not\ntrying to harass you or impress you, it was just a really vivid dream and I\nmean, \n\nIt was a\nreally mutual, sort of childish, innocent sequence of acts.

2Lq5pZrbpHc,"I really love all the Mormonts. they all are just such likable characters. Jeor and Jorah are both men who have pasts that weigh heavy on their minds, and how they act in the present. they aren't boastful, like many other great warriors from other houses, yet they are incredible fighters. Jeor clearly has great compassion for all the members of the nights watch, even the worst of them, treating them as his own both when giving affection and support and when punishment and disappointment. I like the Show's depiction of Jorah's fighting skills, yes, he'll get hit, and he isn't the is flawless superhuman, but has a seeming inability to give up. he preservers through the hardships, through getting the shit kicked out of him, because he knows he can take more than any he faces can give, and he has the motivation to keep pushing on. Lyanna is interesting, as she's the most boastful Mormont, but not in an arrogant way. She's proud of her people, home, and family and clearly has a deep love for them. she is also one of the most if not the most capable child-ruler we've seen on the show. she doesn't let adults bully her or control her as a puppet like Jeoffrey, Tommen, and Robin Aryn. She knows she must assert herself and make decisions on her own to avoid being trampled politically.  The Mormonts are an underrated house.",0,0

He had a lot to gain by doing her harm but he gave that all up to do the right thing so Jorah is all good in my book and I hope he survived this story.,0,0

an5vV5aw74I,"Space Mountain in Disneyland Paris has inversions (unlike other versions), and a part on the outside of the structure.\nWhen the park originally opened, the Mission was based on Jules Verne's Voyage to the Moon, the outside part is shaped like the Columbiad cannon and you were shot towards the moon, which featured a Moon face as in the famous silent movie by George Melies.\nThen it was updated to Mission 2 which took one beyond the moon (and no longer featured the Moon face).\nMission 2 in early 2017 made way for a permanent Star Wars themed Hyperspace Mountain. Only the outside of the building is still reminiscent of the Jules Verne - Steampunk styling. Oh, and they still have the Baltimore Gun Club room in the waiting line that's somewhat as it had been.\n\nThere's no Enchanted Tiki Room , Matterhorn Bobsleds or Splash Mountain in Paris.",0,0

3fILUAGw2mE,"Your entire theory rests on the idea that Lust is creating her body from pure energy. Maybe she is. But is it not conceivable that she's simply transmuting the air around her into flesh or pulling the particles of her that Mustang just blasted off back into place? That would probably cost her less energy than making herself from scratch.\n\nYou also assume the homonculi all have equal shares of father's souls. But that's simply not true, as evidence by their very different abilities which have different costs and the different ways that they die. For example, Wrath just has super-human strength speed, reflexes, and vision, but doesn't regenerate. Sloth can regenerate, but his ability to do so is significantly less than Lust's or Gluttony's, with him being killed not by nine intense fiery explosions, but by a couple strong men and some sharp spikes of rock created by an alchemist. These guys aren't all equal, and so your estimate both of the number of souls and of their value is off.\n\nAnd you also got the alchemy method wrong. Western alchemy works not because of father but rather by opening The Gate within every alchemist. Father knows how to cut off their access to that gate temporarily.",0,0

3fILUAGw2mE,"I don‚Äôt usually comment on these sorts of things, but FMA has been my jam for the better part of 15 years now, so you better believe I‚Äôm gonna jump on this like Gluttony on a burger. There‚Äôs several issues in this theory that throw the calculations way off.\n\nFirst of all, the inclusion of the Seven Heavenly Virtues. First of all, the Virtues don‚Äôt appear until Aurelius Clemens Prudentius‚Äô poem Psychomachia, written around the 5th Century AD, while the Seven Deadly Sins as we know them first appear in the 4th Century through the writings of Evagrius Ponticus. (Thanks Wikipedia!) With a full 100 years between the two, it‚Äôs pretty safe to say that these are not equivalent parts of the soul. Of course, all of that is a moot point since Hiromu Arakawa herself has said that Christianity does not exist in the world of FMA, so including the Virtues at all is a no-go from day one. With that, the calculation of the average number of souls per Homunculi should be doubled. This is of course assuming that each Homunculi has the same number of souls. \n\nSecond, the calculation of how many souls it takes to regenerate Lust during the fight against Mustang has two MAJOR assumptions that completely ruin the theory overall. First, it assumes that Lust‚Äôs Philosopher‚Äôs Stone is ‚Äúfull‚Äù. We know for a fact (A Film Fact!) that Lust has been killed at least once before thanks to Maes Hughes (RIP in pepperonis), and it‚Äôs safe to assume that she‚Äôs been killed several times before then. The FMA fandom wiki puts her age at about 250 years old, and although I can‚Äôt find any source for that, I think it‚Äôs safe to say that she‚Äôs been around the block a couple dozen times. This means that she‚Äôd also have the normal energy drain from aging, on top of the massive dips when she‚Äôs killed.\n\nThird, and I‚Äôm really surprised that MatPat didn‚Äôt bring this up, but since Alchemy is a science, it‚Äôs also subject to our good old friend Entropy. Transmuting energy into matter has to have a massive hit to entropy. We don‚Äôt have anything close to exact numbers, but I think we can assume that the entropy created when turning a soul into flesh is pretty massive. \n\nAlso, and this is a nitpick, but we really can‚Äôt assume Lust‚Äôs weight. Both Envy and Gluttony have been shown to be much heavier than they appear physically, so it‚Äôs not outside the realm of possibility for her actual mass to be much higher.\n\nBut hey! Assuming spherical Homunculi in a vacuum, at least your math is right! And that‚Äôs juuuuuuust a theory! An aaaaaaanime theory!",0,0

Lust dies and regenerates a couple of different times in the series before she ultimately meets her end. Not to mention, she's 400+ years old so there is probably an uncountable number of similar instances of regeneration throughout her lifespan that we don't see. Also, it's reasonable to assume that using her powers would drain some of the energy from her stone, and unless she only recently began taking an active role in things, she's been draining that energy for centuries. Though it's probably a drop in the bucket, comparatively.\n\nThis whole comment is merely for the sake of being pedantic and pretending I'm smarter than I am, and I'm fairly certain that other commenters have made these points already, but as a youtube commenter it is my right, nay, my *duty*, to press on anyway.\n\nEnjoyed the video as always, good job on the theorizing :)",0,0

There was no dumb coy aspect present, I was being very\ndirect about it, but there was humor in the air. I have to tell you my\ngirlfriend is SOFT, on a tactile level, my mind just ran those sensations when\nI slid into your mouth (it¬¥s the internet, I know it¬¥s not impressive to write\nthings like this, shut up, I¬¥m not trying to impress you). I mean, I know I\ndon¬¥t really know you, and I don¬¥t want to cheat on my girlfriend lol, I¬¥m not\ntrying to harass you or impress you, it was just a really vivid dream and I\nmean, \n\nIt was a\nreally mutual, sort of childish, innocent sequence of acts.

2Lq5pZrbpHc,"I really love all the Mormonts. they all are just such likable characters. Jeor and Jorah are both men who have pasts that weigh heavy on their minds, and how they act in the present. they aren't boastful, like many other great warriors from other houses, yet they are incredible fighters. Jeor clearly has great compassion for all the members of the nights watch, even the worst of them, treating them as his own both when giving affection and support and when punishment and disappointment. I like the Show's depiction of Jorah's fighting skills, yes, he'll get hit, and he isn't the is flawless superhuman, but has a seeming inability to give up. he preservers through the hardships, through getting the shit kicked out of him, because he knows he can take more than any he faces can give, and he has the motivation to keep pushing on. Lyanna is interesting, as she's the most boastful Mormont, but not in an arrogant way. She's proud of her people, home, and family and clearly has a deep love for them. she is also one of the most if not the most capable child-ruler we've seen on the show. she doesn't let adults bully her or control her as a puppet like Jeoffrey, Tommen, and Robin Aryn. She knows she must assert herself and make decisions on her own to avoid being trampled politically.  The Mormonts are an underrated house.",0,0

He had a lot to gain by doing her harm but he gave that all up to do the right thing so Jorah is all good in my book and I hope he survived this story.,0,0

JU21shbaVBo,What‚Äôs the name of the host?,0,0
JU21shbaVBo,"Actually, CG cartoons do reuse animation (although I believe this is much more common in gaming). The animation isn't in the model itself -it's a file on it's own. You can apply the movements of one character to another if their models are similar enough. Take a closer look next time you play a game or watch a lower budget animated movie -you may notice a bunch of different enemies have the same walk or that all the characters dancing on screen dance with uncanny precision.",0,0
JU21shbaVBo,"It's not excusable to me. For a tv show that has a freaking deadline and is on a tiny budget, okay. And to justify it with the fast food animation of Hanna Barbara is just sad. If can provide me with non-Disney feature examples than okay, but if not then I say shame on you Disney!",0,0
JU21shbaVBo,"I think it would be kind of a pain to redraw scenes, and wouldn't be lazy even if they directly copied.  Copying animation isn't like copying a fashion style, after all.  And in certain places, like from Aurora's gown to Belle's gown which are very different, it might be more work.

And what happened? The Lion King didn't reuse a single bit of animation, and it ended up being Pocahontas that reused animation from it, instead. Not to mention TLK buried Pocahontas in the box office.",0,0
JU21shbaVBo,"There's a shot of reeds blowing in the foreground that, I think, first appeared in a very early Disney short (it may even be The Old Mill that's been popping up in countless Disney movies ever since. The last time I remember seeing it was in The Little Mermaid, transformed into what was, I imagine, supposed to be seaweed blowing in some underwater breeze -- but it was clearly the same reeds transported from the very beginning of Disney animation.\n\nBut I don't think this is really a time saver. At this point, I think it's sort of an inside joke, a wink at this element that's been around in Disney movies forever.",0,0

JU21shbaVBo,Wondered if they recycled shots! I first recognized this in Robin Hood when the scene of him and Marian dancing looked identical to that of the scene in Aristocats when Thomas danced with Duchess.,0,0
JU21shbaVBo,"At first I was hesitant to watch this fearing it was just another of countless clips shows noting the recycling of Disney footage, but I appreciate how you offered greater context by noting the reuse of 3D models and the repurposing of other assets in live-action film. That turned this from a video about a trivial fact most observant people were aware of into something actually insightful. Well done.",0,0
JU21shbaVBo,"I never really noticed it in Disney movies... I watched them a lot as a kid and that kinda thing slipped past me.  HOWEVER, I did notice a lot of recycled animation in cartoons- Scooby Doo as shown here had many, many animations that were used over and over and over!  I've certainly become more aware of it as I've gotten older.\n\nThe most egregious use of recycled animation for me had to be Gundam SEED and Gundam SEED Destiny.  They began to feel like clip shows and in Destiny I actually started feeling ill after seeing the same animation used for the 20th time.  I eventually got hyper-aware of it and it made watching the series nearly impossible to watch (and not just for its sub-par writing!)",0,0

It just doesn't sit right or feel good, as an animator myself. \n\nOn a plus side for all that traditionally create animation, backgrounds by hand; those who still or chose to do it, are loved more than CGI animators. Just like paint shop pro (computer helped artworks)- all of the CGI artworks start to blend in together. You do what everyone else does, you never stick out (It's all the same: all become a blur/not as memorable). Sure, photo shop/paint shop pro and CGI movies have their place in style - but all of the traditional/hand crafted arts, are ever more adored and become ever more admired; because of the opposite growing trends. It takes longer for me to create an animation - but I can look back and know I can physically touch my artwork while I am making it. I am a hands-on artist. :)",0,0

TO5cYWd12lQ,"Welcome to the PC master race. Monitors, depending on the budget, are tough. I'd say, for editing, the most important options are resolution and color recreation. Gaming monitors have amazing refresh rates and low input lag but tend to come with TN panels instead of IPS, which is no good for editing. I'd stay away unless they have an IPS panel. For a mouse, it depends lol. A wireless one that I would recommend for you would be the Logitech MX Master 2S. Otherwise, look at the features you want, and don't be afraid of a mouse because its labeled as a gaming mouse. Gotta get a mechanical keyboard too. Expensive, seriously, but so worth it in terms of durability alone. Then you need to look at the type of key switch. The most popular, and kind of default, type are Cherry MX switches. If you want a tactile feel and click on each keystroke, I recommend Cherry MX Blue switches. If you want that feel with a quieter click, I recommend the Cherry Mx Brown switches. If you want a smooth keystroke, the Cherry MX red are the ones. Logitech and Razer make their own key switches, but do tell you what type of Cherry MX switches they are comparable to.",0,0

yNaLblrdflU,Amazing how they look up to the white gangsters but call black men thugs doing the exact same shit. This country is full of hypocrisy to the point nobody believes the bullshit anymore. Not even us. Americans try n tell everybody else what they issue is and we are all fuked up.  This country has a I'm written rule. Do the crime. Just don't get caught. Cause then we make a example out of u. Meanwhile the biggest people in charge in this country have some of the worst habits and addictions poor people have.  Yet they are never told on exploited embarssed or exposed. That happens to the black people. Even poor white people have it better then us. At least they can clean up and act the part. If your white n poor in American your a fuk moron that deserves poverty.  The entire country is set up for u to win.  Black kid plays with you gun outside and is killed like a dog. White kid shoots up a church full of blacks.  Not only is he caught without being killed. They brought him cheese burgers.  Lmaoooooo that's the hate white people have for blacks. Read the comments under Travon Martins stories you tube. This country hates anything black unless it have a team jersey on scoring points or singing and dancing for u pale face peices of individual shits. And we need to hate them back. They hate so they win. The can piss in a bottle and call it champagne.  If we piss in a bottle it's just piss. And I'm sick of the double standard.  But that will all b over soon enough.  The old ways and old people are dying. What was the minority last year won't b soon. I wonder how blacks will treat whites in 50 years. I pray it's at least a fraction of the hospitality that has been shown to us. Since the first aboriginal was killed on this land along with the slaves brung from Africa.  I hope that dept is paid back times 20. But I can only wish for something in the same category my ancestors felt while being whipped shot killed chased down and hunted by you people. I will never bite my younger when it comes to how I feel about u people. Like Rich Piana called magic Johnson a filthy nigger. For what? But when the racist bastard died they tried to make him some beautiful person. Fuk him dead n alive. He was a racist fuk yard. Yet everybody tried to say no big deal. He don't feel like that anymore and it was years ago. Such bullshit.  Pure bullshit,0,0

Us White Males need a white ethnic state so we can have our own nationalist society that works for only us enlightened right-wingers. I know this might sound stupid but honestly I'm a gamer, 14, and so are my friends. And I think it's stupid that we are smarter than the Libtard teachers that my corrupt school district has. You see I'm like Rick, I'm too smart for school. I watch historical and political videos on my free time and have came to a conclusion that conservatism is the ideology of the future.

The original Star Trek often had award-winning sci fi writers doing episodes whereas NG was essentially typical TV writers of the time period. The Psycho lady spent way too many times explaining why she ate chocolate whenever she was upset, Worf spent way too many times explaining Klingon culture and losing fights and how many times could Data sty something that had never worked before....but if the cosmic sub megaton defibrillator untensed the quantum flux hiccups at just the right intensity without waking up the giant space warthog, then it just might work and save the ship from an otherwise undefeatable threat?

bY8-TUD3_Zo,"Matpat I'm disappointed, Rick's tongue isn't an electrode, there are no h+ gated neurons in the neocortex, therefore the acidic compounds wouldn't be able to cause impulses, the presence of sodium is completely irrelevant, the extracellular space is already saturated with sodium, the tongue wouldn't be able to stimulate neurons in the neocortex, which are largely ligand gated with glutamate and GABA for inhibitory neurons.\n\nIn fact, the presence of more extracellular sodium would prevent the conduction of action potentials, the electrostatic gradient would be fucked, and potassium would be unable to leave the neuron(like charges repel one another, potassium and sodium are positively charged, the excess of sodium would erase the electrostatic gradient necessary to for ionic conductances).\n\n Therefore, even if Rick's tongue managed to drive an action potential in the recently killed roaches neocortex, that would be it; he would get one action potential to fire and the cell would be unable to continue into the falling phase of the AP, leaving it depolarized; as you're no doubt aware, there is no known neuron that can cause a post synaptic action potential with just one spike, the highest they go up to is a post synaptic depolarization of 10 millivolts; which is still about 15 away from threshold potential in a typical neocortical neuron.\n\nThe only way a cell would be able to get back to polarized and hyperpolarized would be via passive leak conductances and the sodium potassium pump, which enters a dysfunctional state when there hypernatremia is taking place.\n\nSo no, pickle Rick would never get the roach to move like they can move in laboratories with electrodes directly feeding current into the cells.\n\nAnd of course there's the issue of how few cells in the neocortex the tongue would even be able to effect, I doubt it would even have effects on layer 3-6.\n\nAll in all, sloppy work.",0,0

Other than that, I think the video was perfect.",0,0
8I8G5XQI9_w,"Loved it! I just thought that you should jump less and step more into the pad. When you are just jumping on the pad, the puppet gets out of life, there is no personality on him.

TO5cYWd12lQ,"Bying a Keyboard and Mouse is a huge preference. It depends upon what you're doing exactly. \nHere are few examples.\nMechanical keys - LOUD, like really LOUD, but sturdy and last longer. Keys able to be changed/replaced easily. Popular among gamers who bash buttons. Always expensive due to the materials used. A bit overpriced, too! Go for either Razer of Corsair ones.\n\nMembrane based keyboard - Different variations to choose from. Slightly loud, but not as much as mechanical ones. Most common ones used worldwide for typing and offices. Choosing one is simply a matter of search what's available. \n\nScissor-based keyboards - The most silent ones out there. Notable mention are Natec Genesys RX22 and Red Dragon Karura K502. Very silent, my personal favorites, very cheap, too! They're good for both gaming and typing alike. Think >laptop buttons< type. \n\nThere are membrane x mechanical keyboards, but I think that's just stupid. I choose keyboards based on their sound since I prefer things to be kind of silent due to the music I listen to, and I think that functionality is far better than elegance/sturdiness of a keyboard. \n\nAs for the MICE you want to choose - think SENSORS. Find the best optical sensors and sticks with them. I personally use Razer DeathAdder Elite and it's an amazing MICE. \nYou want to pick a MICE that suits your HAND LENGTH and feels comfortable to work with.

TO5cYWd12lQ,"if you're spending 2,700 dollars on a PC, you'll want a mechanical keyboard. I have a Razer Blackwidow ultimate, with razer green switches. i found a guide to the different switches https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPbGZRouc8Q",0,0
TO5cYWd12lQ,"Keyboard - obviously mechanical. I'd personally recommend the WASD V2. I got one over a year ago, and it has held up very well. It's a bit pricier than a lot of other mechanical keyboards, but it's built really well, has an elegant and minimalist look, and has insane customization from the factory. You can easily match your purple / white / black aesthetic and customize the legends. (Although it might have a slightly different shade of purple.) You've also got tons of switch options, but you'll probably want to look mostly at the Cherry MX Brown, Blue, or Clear switches.\n\nMouse - I use the Logitech G602. It's pretty handy since it has 6 thumb buttons with per-application customization. The MX Master is also really good and comfortable, more designed for general productivity than gaming.\n\nMonitor - IDK, probably a nice ultrawide or 4K IPS panel or something. My monitors are trash, so you probably don't want to take advice from me ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø",0,0

TO5cYWd12lQ,"Sara, make sure you remove the plastic from the case window. The cooling inside your pc won't really be affected by it, it just looks better.\n\nAs for suggestions:\nI'd definitely go with the Logitech MX Master for the mouse. It has many features that can be used for editing purposes, and can go wireless so it would work with your macs as well.\nI heavily reccomend Corsair keyboards. They're mechanical and come with different switches which change the force needed for a keypress to register, as well as the sound they make. The one you were using with Austin in the video is a Corsair keyboard. They also have RGB backlighting, which PC gamers love.",0,0

Then I got the ultrawide and boom. Never want to use anything else again. And since you're editing/color grading, get something IPS. I got the ASUS PG348Q, but this and the Acer Predator X34 are fine choices. They are currently the top notch ultrawides used by most.",0,0

Today i'm using a Macbook Pro retina mid 2012 and a decked out Mac Pro 2013. Which is perfectly fine for what i want to do, (working with logic pro and final cut pro). I understand that you are still in search of a mouse and some other peripherals.\n\nNow, for the keyboard, there are so so many (good) choices that is something up to you.\n\nI know the mechanical keyboards from Corsair are very popular as are their mouse/mice's.\n\nNow, for a mouse/mice in particular, i know the Logitech MX Master Mouse 2 is very very good for editing. Not sure if you already own that one or not.\n\nAs far as monitors go, again, there are so many, but i know LG ultra wide's are very popular in the pc and actually mac world too :-)\n\nHope's this helps a bit. I'm not sure how big you want the monitor to be, personally, i would go from anywhere from 29 to 34 (when you would take an ultra wide). I don't think i would want to go bigger for a pc monitor, you can just as well hook up a tv at that point (if going bigger).

yNaLblrdflU,What I really don't understand is why is America praising the Italian mob knowing that they're no different from gangs in the street even games in the street or more organized just like the mob but my point is why is America praising the Italian mob by even renaming the Italian mob and calling them the American mob always trying to snatch something up for this country quick to make a movie about John Gotti this is the second movie I believe they made about John Gotti but did they ever make a movie about Tookie the founder of the Crips in California that's no different than the mob the only thing is that people believe the Crips started out as a gang but they started out as a positive image to protect their community against drugs and any other type of negativity this country is run by a bunch of bigots hypocrites and racist MF to continue two praise the Italian mob but when it comes to anything else pertaining to the minority like the Latin Kings the Decepticons the Bloods and the Crips the low life Nation you know me movies that's coming out in the theaters for them but they support the Italian mob and rename it the American mom like that's supposed to be a part of American history America is full of BS and I was born and raised here honestly I wish they never even showed this movie so damn disgrace.,0,0

uoTIcwHK_aw,"hey Jaden/internet I have a similar tale which I will like to tell.\n\nOnce in year two. We were leaving this tiny hill area witch was this sort of play zone and somehow I was singled out until all that was left was me and three other kids. Two of them were just standing around to watch the fireworks of what was about to go on and there was one kid who I am going to call Sam. Sam was the school bully in my year level and a pretty tough kid. Anyway I was standing by a tree and he came rushing at me so I picked up a stick and jabbed in his detection. what must have happened is it scratched next to his eye. He then started crying and lightly punching me. THEN my bully smarts kicked in all if you ignore him the problem will go away thanks brain, thanks. \n\nSo I began walking to my class and to my relief he quickly stopped and wandered off. So I just went back to class. I can't remember much after that but later I was called to the deputy principles office ad I freaked out but I internalized (hopefully) then went to his office. The deputy principle was this serious sporty guy who looked sullen 95% of the time. I sat in a chair in front of him and he said something along the lines of Sam told us you stabbed him in the eye with a stick, is this true?.\n\nThankfully the devious part of me just when 'hold up, I got this' then I said to the DP I was standing still holding a stick and he ran into it. and they bought it. Entirely! It must have helped that I was the teachers pet of the school with a little halo (of lies).\nSam never bothered me from then on and I haven't told a single soul the truth of what happened that day, until now, I have told the internet... yeah...",0,0

bY8-TUD3_Zo,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewers head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenevs Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens.

bY8-TUD3_Zo,"HOLD IT! If you were to look deeper into it you would realize at the very least rick doesn't have a skeletal structure, ergo a skull. What this means is that the swelling of his brain and nervous system is a non-problem as his brain wouldn't be pressured into a stone-like container such as the skull and his pickle form would adapt to his swelling nervous system. Even in the worst case scenario he would only die when he regained his humanity as the salt content in his blood would immediately kill him, but otherwise pickle rick is entirely possible.",0,0

But the dimension that the real morty is from that rick died but noone in the family knows that but rick and has to lie to everyone just so he can hide his greif. Meanwhile evil morty became president of the citidel so he could be in a position of power and kill the c-137 rick to get revenge for leaving him behind.

bY8-TUD3_Zo,"To be quite frank, one does need to have a rather significant amount of intellect to comprehend Richard & Mortimer. Why, just yesterday I attempted to show my cousin (who has just entered his seventh year) the episode where the titular character, Rick, turns himself into a pickled cucumber. He laughed at the mere thought of a man become fermented vegetable, but I sat there watching, lamenting the deeper message: the death of intellectual pursuit, the desensitization to societal filth, muck, and mire, and the shameless abandonment of psychological understanding.\n\nAt the end my cousin turned to me and proclaimed, I am the scientist that was once named Rick, but I have now become a pickled cucumber. Look at me, I am pickled Rick!, and I could not help but smile, not that the line he had just recited was humorous, but at the realization that this, in front of my very eyes, was the sum of what the episode had just warned against.\n\nI cannot blame my cousin just as much as a man cannot blame a dog for consuming its own bile. It merely does not know any better, and what could be said about a man who judges things he does not have merit to judge?",0,0

bY8-TUD3_Zo,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewers head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. üòÇ\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

Other than that, I think the video was perfect.",0,0

Or an IPS Ultra Wide IPS panel with a 3840X1440. Personally I trust Dell monitors and so far I've had good luck with them. my oldest Dell 1080P was bought back in 2006 and it's still working today and I like their contrast ratio and brightness. Just set them both to 100 and good to go. Blacks are black and whites are bright. Also if you don't want a Dell Monitor you can always look into a Samsung or LG or even ASUS. They all make Ultra Wide and once you go there you will never want to go back to 16:9 ratio again.,0,0

Check out cable mod to see if you can get some white and purple cables for your build instead of the plain black ones. Again, aesthetics. :D \n3. Check out the MX Master mouse.

iK7lICvUhCI,"I'm still hoping Beth is a clone. Maybe the clone didn't have 0% chance of going blade runner like Rick thought because he underestimated how smart Beth was? And maybe the gun was to put her down, but when he saw the family saying it didn't matter, (and he had no idea when the real Beth was going to come back and said the clone would be there to do her job), Rick just sucked it up and thought let's just let this clone do its thing til Beth comes back then deal with it. Plus, it's been established numerous times that Jerry's an idiot (Rick's words not mine!), so since when are we taking his word for anything??¬†Buuuut maybe that's just wishful thinking.¬†\nSince the opposite is also likely, and maybe her development was just as simple as her learning to value her family more over Rick, rather than becoming more badass and in touch with the parts of her that make her like her dad. \nThat being said~ having Beth go off on an adventure would mean c-137 has the Rickiest-Rick family of all. With a Morty that occasionally talks back and takes charge, a radicalised Summer, and a radicalised Beth! Pretty sweet. Plus *cough* Epic clone vs Beth battle *cough*\nMan this is a very biased post.

iK7lICvUhCI,This season was so nothing if that was the finale omg,0,0
iK7lICvUhCI,"Counter theory. Even though Rick may have not had enough time to clone Beth by the time Morty and Summer get home, this does not mean that at the dinner scene that there isn't a clone of Beth being cooked up at that time. Beth could very easily have been that affectionate to Rick and the kids because she knew that it would be the last time she would see them for a while. Beth may have left in between episodes or when the kids were sleeping making the Beth in the finale actually a clone. Rick is able to clone Tommy with just a finger so we know that the person being cloned does not have to be there for the process, only a part of them, for example, a sample of Beth's blood, a few strands of hair, or some skin cells. My theory, dear Matpat, is that while Beth may be the real deal at the end of The ABC's of Beth episode that by the time the finale rolls around she could be gone already, replaced with a clone, and no one would notice. \n\nNOTE THAT THIS PARAGRAPH WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS FOR THE FINALE. That's why in the finale Beth brings up the discussion she had with Rick about being a clone, it was the show creator's way of reminding you that this happened, and they wouldn't do something like that unless it was VERY important. Which is further supported by the fact that it's so heavily focused on in regards to Beth and Jerry. Remember what she says while she's in Jerry's apartment, that she remembers hating that night but that she no longer does. Yes, it could be argued that this is simply because of her coming to accept herself for who she truly is and missing Jerry, but it's more likely, at least to me that this is what the CLONE is feeling. Rick may be a genius, but it's not like his experiments do not occasionally go wrong or have a fault. Let's not forget that the entire population of one of the realities were turned into monsters back in season one. Not to mention that wouldn't it be a much more satisfying plot point later when the real Beth comes home?\n\nSPOILERS CONTINUE. This is also why Rick does NOT shoot Beth at the end, it's not because she's his real daughter, it's because he doesn't want Beth's cover to be blown. He loves Beth, he even says so when suggesting that he clone her. He knows that Beth needs Rick to continue acting as if she's still there with them.\n\nOMG SO MANY SPOILERS LOL! So with the evidence I have described, her being affectionate to her family because she's leaving, the fact that she could have easily left between episodes or when no one was looking, that just because we don't see Beth being cloned doesn't mean it's not happening, the fact that it's brought up again in the finale to remind us that it happened, her renewed love for Jerry possibly being a flaw in the cloning process, and Rick wanting to maintain Beth's cover, would it really be so strange if finale Beth is clone Beth?\n\nSo while I do agree with your theory that Beth is real at the end of The ABC's of Beth, it's not impossible that she's a clone in the finale. But hey, that's just a theory...",0,0

Another thing is that Summer and Morty were taken out of school. That had to be on Monday. Another thing is wouldn't the cloning process take a lot less time because he has a full Beth to use. Rick said about 3 hours when he seen he only had the finger. He had the full Beth there so it would probably take a lot less time. And the cloning equipment was already set up so they don't have to bring it out. Any thoughts on my conclusions?",0,0

iK7lICvUhCI,What if rick already had a clone of beth in the lair under the garage and constantly had her memorys updated and we do know that the lair has multiple rooms from the mortys mind blowers episode so a clone could be down there and about the time rick could have portaled home and erased tommys memory of it and in the mind blower episode we see rick always has it on him so yeah.,2,0
iK7lICvUhCI,what if they just teleported the car back home.,2,0
iK7lICvUhCI,Rick knows he is on a show he knows he can time travel and just because he says he wouldn't doesn't make it true also maybe he hadn't cloned her at that point but he she may have changed her mind before the next weeks episode.,0,1

D&D are completely stupid and I'm starting to wonder if they read the first two books, got bored, and then just read spark notes to get them through the rest. They care more about their friendships with the actors than the dialogue the actors speak (bad pussy, dickon jokes, Tyrion and little finger's entire script) they're more about shock value than cohesive plots and actions for the characters that make sense (Jon giving up the north even though Dany had already consented to fight with his people and Arya wanting to kill Sansa) and most obviously, they care more about big action set pieces and pointless dragon/ polar bear scenes than Jon being with the direwolf that represents his connection with his REAL family, the Starks (because Ghost being with him at Dragonstone would remind him of the family that we literally see him ignore except to write *once* in the months he spends on the island).

They go to his home (in the bubbles) and have dinner with his new girl friend. The next time we see them they have been hunting all Sunday and are tired wanting to go home. When we see them again Daddy has driven them home (at night in the rain) and that would make it Sunday night. Next we see them getting pulled out of school so they can run form new girlfriend. That would make it Monday and when they get home after the hunting girlfriend thing its later in the day and dinner time with mom. \n\nI am not saying your theory is wrong but your time line just dose not add up to me. Why are they at school? Why would they be at school on a Sunday? Maybe the writers just put in clocks all over to make people look at that to though you off or maybe that just how the world works, I mean a lot of people have clocks telling us time.",0,0

iK7lICvUhCI,"So, here's the thing... Rick is smart... He's insanely smart... And as we saw in a previous episode he plans for eventualities in advance. (The Memory Mix-up Episode.) This entire theory falls apart when you look at the other side of the pizza. Yes... There was no time travel involved in getting the pizza.... But what if he had one laying around in advance? What if he already considered this might happen and had cloned Beth in before he even talked to her about it? He could have even revved up the cloner before they left to stop the execution.

What I am proposing however is that what if only the pizza scene happened on a different day? Whose to say that cloning Beth didn't take that long and afterwards she went to bed to prepare for the start of her adventures the following day (Or maybe skip sleeping and just start adventuring) and then the next day have Rick test out the new clone with the kids and all we are seeing is the end of a long day of testing the clone ended by some nice family-time pizza!

iK7lICvUhCI,Well what if they went on a Friday afternoon right so that's mean they could've done it on Sunday but another question pop up tho didn't jerry picked Morty at school and one last thing maybe the affectionate beth and rick might be her goodbyes the last meal she's going to have with her family,0,0

Friday is generally accepted as part of the weekend, and in all the cases of joint custody I've known in my life, the kids left Friday, and came back Sunday.

iK7lICvUhCI,But what about the time in season 2 last ep where they stopped time,0,0
iK7lICvUhCI,"When Beth spirals into the existential angst, the clock is at the same time as it was when they cloned Tommy. That would mean the hands on the clock may not be a calculated decision. Did the episode say that the execution was supposed to happen in the afternoon? If so than that is a spot on theory, but I can't agree unless the execution happening  in the afternoon is as factual as you say it is.",0,0
iK7lICvUhCI,Just because they drove to the penitentiary doesn't mean they drove back. Maybe after dropping of Tommy they teleported themselves and the car back to the driveway.,0,0
iK7lICvUhCI,"Jerry pulled Morty and Summer out of school after he broke up with his new girlfriend. If we take this into account, the hunt was on Saturday night and the execution was still scheduled for Sunday. We never saw Summer and Morty get home Saturday night. In fact they could have gotten home Sunday night after the hunt the next day, which would mean that Jerry broke up with his girlfriend Monday morning when the two were in school. Meaning that when Summer and Morty got home on Monday night, Beth could have been a clone, because they got pizza on Monday and not Sunday.",0,0

X_PZvUM8P_U,"Of all the things in season seven, this bullshit is what pissed me off the most (besides Littlefinger and the Jonerys buffoonery) This story is supposed to be about people. It's supposed to be about treachery and relationships and the complexity of human nature. It's not spending millions of dollars on a fucking zombie polar bear. D&D are completely stupid and I'm starting to wonder if they read the first two books, got bored, and then just read spark notes to get them through the rest. They care more about their friendships with the actors than the dialogue the actors speak (bad pussy, dickon jokes, Tyrion and little finger's entire script) they're more about shock value than cohesive plots and actions for the characters that make sense (Jon giving up the north even though Dany had already consented to fight with his people and Arya wanting to kill Sansa) and most obviously, they care more about big action set pieces and pointless dragon/ polar bear scenes than Jon being with the direwolf that represents his connection with his REAL family, the Starks (because Ghost being with him at Dragonstone would remind him of the family that we literally see him ignore except to write *once* in the months he spends on the island).

X_PZvUM8P_U,"Instead of them introducing Uncle Benjin during this time and having a reunion with Jon, they decided to spend thousands if not millions on a stupid ass polar bear. They could have sent Benjin to the wall to get Davos to send ravens instead of having gendry run 30 miles an hour to get there.",9,0
X_PZvUM8P_U,I'm so loving the comment section,13,1
X_PZvUM8P_U,"This scene was unnecessary, why didn't you use it to build up Benjins return instead? The writers of this season was stupid as shit, people didn't start liking GOT because of the crazy action but because of the characters, and although action is awesome, it gets tasteless if you don't have a good plot line to follow it. Please get good again in the last season thanks",6,0
X_PZvUM8P_U,"Dear Game of Thrones: FYI, for S8 we would rather have the direwolves over war elephants from Essos... Sincerely, The Fans\nP.S. No one wanted a fooking polar bear when we could have had scenes with Ghost!",8,0
X_PZvUM8P_U,"Quit bragging about something that is literally the biggest waste of time and resources in the entire show. I still liked this season, but it's no secret the writing has taken a nosedive recently, and when keep seeing you guys talking about your zombie polar bear you had to work so hard as a team to get in, it makes me realize just how much worse at writing compelling entertainment the Davids are than George.",6,0
X_PZvUM8P_U,"Of all the things in season seven, this bullshit is what pissed me off the most (besides Littlefinger and the Jonerys buffoonery) This story is supposed to be about people. It's supposed to be about treachery and relationships and the complexity of human nature. It's not spending millions of dollars on a fucking zombie polar bear. D&D are completely stupid and I'm starting to wonder if they read the first two books, got bored, and then just read spark notes to get them through the rest. They care more about their friendships with the actors than the dialogue the actors speak (bad pussy, dickon jokes, Tyrion and little finger's entire script) they're more about shock value than cohesive plots and actions for the characters that make sense (Jon giving up the north even though Dany had already consented to fight with his people and Arya wanting to kill Sansa) and most obviously, they care more about big action set pieces and pointless dragon/ polar bear scenes than Jon being with the direwolf that represents his connection with his REAL family, the Starks (because Ghost being with him at Dragonstone would remind him of the family that we literally see him ignore except to write *once* in the months he spends on the island). This is really long and congrats of you got to the end but in conclusion: D&D can go fuck themselves. We don't need these fuckers in charge.",6,0

X_PZvUM8P_U,"I'm glad we got this polar bear that nobody remembered or talked about after the episode was over. I mean, we had to trade off ghost, a super important character to the story that carries loads of symbolism, so we didn't have him during the uniting of the two biggest characters of the entire show, no matter what kind of symbolism could have been carried through him, but it was all worth it in the end for this epic polar bear. The one that nobody remembers. The one that had no narrative purpose whatsoever.",0,0
X_PZvUM8P_U,"Its a real shame the show seems to be giving in to what the fans want e.g 70% action episodes. It may be what people want but what they want may not necessarily be good for the show. The drawn out discipline and diplomacy of season 6, skipping out what could have been massive action scenes (such as Stannis at Winterfell) lead to the final 2 episodes being the biggest pay offs in TV history for many viewers. I feel game of thrones is just been rushed now, like this zombie polar bear contributed nothing to the plot. No one important died from it, it didn't lead to anything they just killed it and moved on. It was just action for the sake of action. Smart, thought out intelligent screen writing with good pay offs and twists made game of thrones great. Not pointless action like in the walking dead.",0,0

TRY IT ! I bloody bet nothing you sprawl out will equal half of the people Loving or even just mildly curious how its all going to turn out that watch Game of Thrones . Game of Thrones is not what it once was but it is not a regular t.v. series ....it has to come to an ending ; Game of Thrones has broken t.v. history records . The series is Lovingly and excitedly talked about on talk shows.... even when the series is off season and no one from Game of Thrones is scheduled to be on their talk shows. It wasn't up for any EMMY'S this year due to timing of Game of Thrones being later in the year as usual ; the series was given a Thank You by Stephen for giving other t.v. series a chance and as well as the series being mentioned in the beginning of the EMMY'S song introduction it was mentioned a few more times in praise . The nay sayers of Game of Thrones have no sense of imagination to be taken on someone elses journey and not their own ;they want what they like and anything different is off setting ....Game of Thrones is not their journey of story telling and imagination.

CK-0c50Si5w,"I look forward to Sukkot every year- decorating the sukkah with my daughters, the fall foods (mmmm....tzimmes), the smell of the etrog, I could go on and on. What I love and connect to most though is that in comparison to many of our other festival times this one is still celebrated in a similar fashion as it was thousands of years ago. That moment in time when I am waving the lulav and know that my ancestors have done the same for thousands of years gives me a connection to past, present, and future that is difficult to quantify. Chag Sameach Mayim and to everyone else!",0,0

We celebrate because He says Build it. It doesn't hurt so much this year.",0,0

u8f6k9vjl-A,"You look very fresh in this video, like you barely have makeup on. I love it. Plus i recently saw on instagram you saying that you don't have as many views as you used to. I've been watching you for at least two years and to be honest except for the times when you wouldn't upload for like a month or something (which is understandable because you were shooting) i've really enjoyed watching your videos and that hasn't changed. I can imagine that you are not happy with this situation and i hope you start getting as many views as you used to. I'm actually writing all of this because i would like to give you examples of the videos i love watching so that you can have the idea of what attracts people (or at least me lol). I feel like you do too many hauls and i know a lot of people love them and maybe that's just my opinion but a few hauls of the glasses or lingerie might get a little boring after a while. I love watching kind of sit and talk videos where you share some of your experiences and maybe a storytime. I remember you used to make a lot of those a few years ago where you would sit and drink tea and just talk about interesting things that are important to you. I don't want you to feel like i'm intruding because it's really not what i'm trying to do. I'm sorry this comment is so long but i hope you take the time to read it and maybe reply?

fUjicxMPDzs,"Ok, I'm just going to be here hoping this isn't the final product. I loved the first film because of the CGI and the way the shots were done to make the jaegers that much more big and impressive. This just seems more like a trailer for a new fast paced action video game. Another factor I liked about the first film is that the jaegers were slower which in turn created that humongous robot immersion, but I do get that the newer generation of jaegers are built to be quicker. As long as they can still capture the same immersion of the first film (and touch up the CGI), I am A-ok.",0,0

rfMJ-DylWBs,"I put quite a bit of time and consideration into this comment, so you'd better appreciate it. Also I'm right.\n\n0:56 The point of making them overzealous for a slasher film was to show them the cold, tragic reality of death and make them feel guilty. The dickishness of this audience was intentional.\n1:34 Of course they would. A crowd of rowdy dumbasses like that? And they need to so the killer can get away with stabbing Jada Pinkett Smith.\n1:45 The voice chanjjger was obviously collected as evidence.\n3:03 You said it yourself: they're a bigger bag of dicks than a bag of dicks.\n3:14 He just would've done something else!\n8:03 One of the most important staples of the Scream movies is that the killer is always someone with an obsession with movies.\n8:11 OF COURSE movie has time for such an important scene. This movie was partially based on the fear between genders. Men are afraid that women will laugh at them, and women are afraid that men will kill them. This scene shows that Derek isn't afraid to be laughed at, proving that he can't be the killer.\n9:00 Of course he's a laughable cop! That's why we love him! Or, perhaps he gets that Randy is a film geek who knows movies in the same way as the killer, and already survived one killing spree. _Or_ perhaps Dewey's gullibility is merely meant to lower peoples' expectations, thus enhancing his ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation.\n3:12 Okay Jeremy, now you're just making shit up to sin.\n15:09 He's still trying to talk to Sidney. Maybe to apologize this time.\n15:19 She saw lights on.\n17:27 He obviously saw Gale getting kidnapped and followed.\n\nActual Sin Tally: 113",0,0

By the time that organism reaches the desired age you'll be a grandpa.\nDo you even science?! I think not.,1,3

kWaJCOyORvI,"I vaguely remember seeing this movie on either the Scyfy channel or on VHS when I was young and don't remember what I thought of it...probably bored me to death given the long scenes where nothing happened. Now I think of the overall story as a science fiction take on the question of what is and what is not alive...a question that seems simple enough but when you get down to the actual science of it is far more complex than you would think. \nI mean, Replicant's are robots, artificial, and thus you wouldn't normally think of them as being alive, except for the fact that they are sentient and self aware to the point that they believe themselves to be alive, fear death and just want to live.\nThe idea of Deckard being a Replicant himself is definitely a cool part of the story due to how human he seems, which ties into the whole question of what is and is not alive that the story tackles.\nI once heard someone say that science fiction is an existential metaphor that allows us to tell stories of the human condition. This movie serves as an example of people depicting a story of the philosophy and scientific thought that goes into considering what is truly alive despite its form and origin, which is why it has such a significant impact with science fiction fans.",0,0

X_PZvUM8P_U,"Instead of them introducing Uncle Benjin during this time and having a reunion with Jon, they decided to spend thousands if not millions on a stupid ass polar bear. They could have sent Benjin to the wall to get Davos to send ravens instead of having gendry run 30 miles an hour to get there.",9,0
X_PZvUM8P_U,"This scene was unnecessary, why didn't you use it to build up Benjins return instead? The writers of this season was stupid as shit, people didn't start liking GOT because of the crazy action but because of the characters, and although action is awesome, it gets tasteless if you don't have a good plot line to follow it. Please get good again in the last season thanks",6,0
X_PZvUM8P_U,"Dear Game of Thrones: FYI, for S8 we would rather have the direwolves over war elephants from Essos... Sincerely, The Fans\nP.S. No one wanted a fooking polar bear when we could have had scenes with Ghost!",8,0
X_PZvUM8P_U,"Quit bragging about something that is literally the biggest waste of time and resources in the entire show. I still liked this season, but it's no secret the writing has taken a nosedive recently, and when keep seeing you guys talking about your zombie polar bear you had to work so hard as a team to get in, it makes me realize just how much worse at writing compelling entertainment the Davids are than George.",6,0
X_PZvUM8P_U,"Of all the things in season seven, this bullshit is what pissed me off the most (besides Littlefinger and the Jonerys buffoonery) This story is supposed to be about people. It's supposed to be about treachery and relationships and the complexity of human nature. It's not spending millions of dollars on a fucking zombie polar bear. D&D are completely stupid and I'm starting to wonder if they read the first two books, got bored, and then just read spark notes to get them through the rest. They care more about their friendships with the actors than the dialogue the actors speak (bad pussy, dickon jokes, Tyrion and little finger's entire script) they're more about shock value than cohesive plots and actions for the characters that make sense (Jon giving up the north even though Dany had already consented to fight with his people and Arya wanting to kill Sansa) and most obviously, they care more about big action set pieces and pointless dragon/ polar bear scenes than Jon being with the direwolf that represents his connection with his REAL family, the Starks (because Ghost being with him at Dragonstone would remind him of the family that we literally see him ignore except to write *once* in the months he spends on the island). This is really long and congrats of you got to the end but in conclusion: D&D can go fuck themselves. We don't need these fuckers in charge.",6,0

X_PZvUM8P_U,"I'm glad we got this polar bear that nobody remembered or talked about after the episode was over. I mean, we had to trade off ghost, a super important character to the story that carries loads of symbolism, so we didn't have him during the uniting of the two biggest characters of the entire show, no matter what kind of symbolism could have been carried through him, but it was all worth it in the end for this epic polar bear. The one that nobody remembers. The one that had no narrative purpose whatsoever.",0,0
X_PZvUM8P_U,"Its a real shame the show seems to be giving in to what the fans want e.g 70% action episodes. It may be what people want but what they want may not necessarily be good for the show. The drawn out discipline and diplomacy of season 6, skipping out what could have been massive action scenes (such as Stannis at Winterfell) lead to the final 2 episodes being the biggest pay offs in TV history for many viewers. I feel game of thrones is just been rushed now, like this zombie polar bear contributed nothing to the plot. No one important died from it, it didn't lead to anything they just killed it and moved on. It was just action for the sake of action. Smart, thought out intelligent screen writing with good pay offs and twists made game of thrones great. Not pointless action like in the walking dead.",0,0

TRY IT ! I bloody bet nothing you sprawl out will equal half of the people Loving or even just mildly curious how its all going to turn out that watch Game of Thrones . Game of Thrones is not what it once was but it is not a regular t.v. series ....it has to come to an ending ; Game of Thrones has broken t.v. history records . The series is Lovingly and excitedly talked about on talk shows.... even when the series is off season and no one from Game of Thrones is scheduled to be on their talk shows. It wasn't up for any EMMY'S this year due to timing of Game of Thrones being later in the year as usual ; the series was given a Thank You by Stephen for giving other t.v. series a chance and as well as the series being mentioned in the beginning of the EMMY'S song introduction it was mentioned a few more times in praise . The nay sayers of Game of Thrones have no sense of imagination to be taken on someone elses journey and not their own ;they want what they like and anything different is off setting ....Game of Thrones is not their journey of story telling and imagination.  They have their own and one day maybe they will write it .",0,0

They ended on a positive note that should have been the end of the story. \n\nBut of course... Hollywood does not know how to let things die.\n\nThis one looks more for sole purpose of a cash grab while keying in on an epic story. This sequel was not asked for, although if it is good, it will be appreciated. This looks like your every day action film where the big guy saves the world and gets the girl. The first one was not so different from that narrative, but it actually brought some new stuff to the table from old and classic ideas. This is basically a parody. If it is good, I will be thankful.

fUjicxMPDzs,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer‚Äôs head. There‚Äôs also Rick‚Äôs nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they‚Äôre not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn‚Äôt appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick‚Äôs existential catchphrase ‚ÄúWubba Lubba Dub Dub,‚Äù which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev‚Äôs Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I‚Äôm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon‚Äôs genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. üòÇ\n\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

By the time that organism reaches the desired age you'll be a grandpa.\nDo you even science?! I think not.,1,5

fUjicxMPDzs,"HAHAHAHA I GET IT NOW,  at 0:22 you can see a kaijufied crimson typhoon, and at 0:46 you can see more of its model type, then at 0:53 again, you guys see that giant iconic shoulder pad right? and then at 1:36 and 1:38 is a reverse engineered gypsy danger with some more special upgrades (Made by the precursors of course). \n\nThere was this single question floating around, Why are the jaegers fighting each other?\n First of all they are not,  all the so called jaeger v jaeger combat is with a enemy unit revamped by the precursors, and then of course they would want to make the movie seem really thrilling so they would make some intresting cuts to throw us off just like  civil war or any dc/marval movie, \n\nmy prediction is that, after gypsy exploded, the precursors imediatlly returned to the blast site to collect the remains of the jaeger, and after that they realize this type of form for their terra formers would be a really essantial asset so they would make a mass produced type of the jeagers, like the ones ar 0:22 and 0:53 ,then at 1:36 is the master jaeger , or atleast a completly modified gypsy danger that would allow the precursors to have a better understanding about what their oppoonent is doing to thwart them, and eventually succeed in creating a superior model to the old gypsy danger which would classify as a mark 7 or 6, which of course is what humanity is constructing at that very moment, and thats why the jeagers are somewhat evenly matched ( The Gypsy avenger v super gypsy danger) Oh and  plus at the end where it shows a lieutenant class kaiju 1:56 as stated by the scientist in the last movie,\n\n\nOH and im not actually loking forward for this movie, it seems to cartoony though im still gonna watch it and acutally find out if im gonna like it or not",0,0

qDhbIEuwRRc,So happy you guys did a Big Little Lies piece. Another profound thing from this show is the idea of inherited evil being false. \n\nThe show brings up a couple times if there's something in Ziggys past that could be violent going as far as to ask who his father was because Ziggy just looks like an empathetic nurturing child. \n\nIn the end the ones who end up violent are the ones who live with the violence in their home.

Sure you still had the divine Nicole Kidman representing the Aussies, but I worried that something could be lost in adaptation.

6eHExt8C0qw,In retrospect.. The concept does sound obscene..,49,0
6eHExt8C0qw,"Why is this trailer so dramatic? It's a film about how a guy got inspired by his sexual relationship with two women and wrote a fetish fiction about a female superhero. It isn't inception, it's an art film that's trying to say something different about society's treatment of woman in positions of power, ironically choosing the one heroine who's kryptonite is men with whips. At least the concept is original, but I'm not completely sure what this movie is actually trying to say, if anything. Obviously a film doesn't need a message to drill into the viewers head as it can just tell a story, but now of all times? When the feminist movement is being popularized and slandered by the internet? Perhaps it's banking on the popularity of the previous Wonder Woman film, which itself is trying to bank on the feminist movement. (It wasn't even a good movie when being set to the standards of Homecoming and the Batman trilogy, at least to my personal preference.) Either way this won't change the way I look at Wonder Woman. The character has made a social impact sure, but not to the extent of Batman, Spiderman, or hell, even Deadpool. I reason this because she is exactly what she is, a superhero. Except she doesn't stand out or have something she does that seperates her from the especially large crowd of heroes. Spider-Man has to find a way to survive villains he used to know as friends, while balancing his home life and super life. He's just a kid. Batman is a tormented man who's past haunts him, so instead of moping he makes something of himself. He's just sad. Relatable characters. The only relatable thing about Wonder Woman is that she a woman. And that's what her market is based on. Sure she can battle Superman or some villain, and it'd look dope. She's just not an interesting enough character to be intested in. What is her weakness? What keeps her down everyday, just for her to overcome it? Being a woman. I can sure relate to that. Me myself can breath. I was born with it and many don't actually care if I do or don't, but now it's got me chained down. Not relatable. So why is this trailer glorifying the birth of this character? Sales most likely. Or the idea is simply artistic? It doesn't say anything, but it's never been put on screen before. And really at the end of the day, originality is what artists strive for. Thanks Wonder Woman.",29,3

qDhbIEuwRRc,"You guys are great. I love your deep analysis into popular shows. I never thought you guys would do Big Little Lies tho. No one ever really talks about it, but the show was really good.",54,3
qDhbIEuwRRc,So happy you guys did a Big Little Lies piece. Another profound thing from this show is the idea of inherited evil being false. \n\nThe show brings up a couple times if there's something in Ziggys past that could be violent going as far as to ask who his father was because Ziggy just looks like an empathetic nurturing child. \n\nIn the end the ones who end up violent are the ones who live with the violence in their home. Not Ziggy.,49,1

qDhbIEuwRRc,"Excellent video. You really nailed down what I find to be most poignant about this story. I was first introduced to Big Little Lies as an audiobook, which was narrated by an Australian woman (since the author is Australian and the book was initially set there), so it took quite a bit of adjustment for me to get used to seeing the same story in an American setting. Sure you still had the divine Nicole Kidman representing the Aussies, but I worried that something could be lost in adaptation. My fears were completely unfounded as the show actually improved on the book in a number of ways. Many of the complexities were better illustrated in a visual medium than in a book.",3,0

If you really enjoy a movie you tend to look deeper into it and analyze it more (so you're more likely to find the nit-picky details that really don't matter) \nIf the movie is bad you are more likely to just look at the movie and be done with it. Whenever CinemaSins gets REALLY nit-picky about something, it probably just means that they enjoyed the movie so much they needed to either come up with jokey sins or that they had the patience/attention-span to analyze the scene. It's one of those situations where it gets all backwards and stuff",0,0

6eHExt8C0qw,"Why is this trailer so dramatic? It's a film about how a guy got inspired by his sexual relationship with two women and wrote a fetish fiction about a female superhero. It isn't inception, it's an art film that's trying to say something different about society's treatment of woman in positions of power, ironically choosing the one heroine who's kryptonite is men with whips. At least the concept is original, but I'm not completely sure what this movie is actually trying to say, if anything. Obviously a film doesn't need a message to drill into the viewers head as it can just tell a story, but now of all times? When the feminist movement is being popularized and slandered by the internet? Perhaps it's banking on the popularity of the previous Wonder Woman film, which itself is trying to bank on the feminist movement. (It wasn't even a good movie when being set to the standards of Homecoming and the Batman trilogy, at least to my personal preference.) Either way this won't change the way I look at Wonder Woman. The character has made a social impact sure, but not to the extent of Batman, Spiderman, or hell, even Deadpool. I reason this because she is exactly what she is, a superhero. Except she doesn't stand out or have something she does that seperates her from the especially large crowd of heroes. Spider-Man has to find a way to survive villains he used to know as friends, while balancing his home life and super life. He's just a kid. Batman is a tormented man who's past haunts him, so instead of moping he makes something of himself. He's just sad. Relatable characters. The only relatable thing about Wonder Woman is that she a woman. And that's what her market is based on. Sure she can battle Superman or some villain, and it'd look dope. She's just not an interesting enough character to be intested in. What is her weakness? What keeps her down everyday, just for her to overcome it? Being a woman. I can sure relate to that. Me myself can breath. I was born with it and many don't actually care if I do or don't, but now it's got me chained down. Not relatable. So why is this trailer glorifying the birth of this character? Sales most likely. Or the idea is simply artistic? It doesn't say anything, but it's never been put on screen before. And really at the end of the day, originality is what artists strive for. Thanks Wonder Woman.",42,5

qDhbIEuwRRc,So happy you guys did a Big Little Lies piece. Another profound thing from this show is the idea of inherited evil being false. \n\nThe show brings up a couple times if there's something in Ziggys past that could be violent going as far as to ask who his father was because Ziggy just looks like an empathetic nurturing child. \n\nIn the end the ones who end up violent are the ones who live with the violence in their home.

qDhbIEuwRRc,"Excellent video. You really nailed down what I find to be most poignant about this story. I was first introduced to Big Little Lies as an audiobook, which was narrated by an Australian woman (since the author is Australian and the book was initially set there), so it took quite a bit of adjustment for me to get used to seeing the same story in an American setting. Sure you still had the divine Nicole Kidman representing the Aussies, but I worried that something could be lost in adaptation. My fears were completely unfounded as the show actually improved on the book in a number of ways. Many of the complexities were better illustrated in a visual medium than in a book.",4,0

What are you going to do to raise daughters who aren't like these women, to raise daughters who don't like bad boys and who don't reject good men for being too nice like most young women? Feminists claim that it's empowerment for women to go to parties and get banged by guys, yet they attack a guy like Weinstein for banging them (because he's old and not hot enough; that's the real issue, but that doesn't make someone a victim). It's totally hypocritical and total and complete nonsense. Those women went after Weinstein because they were after his money and power, and they used sex to get it. They aren't victims. They're vultures. Weinstein did nothing wrong, and he's the only victim here. This entire society is hypocritical and completely full of it.",0,0

WFb0EDl-JS8,"I love everything you said, Mayim, and here's what I've been thinking as a soon to be mother for the first time, of a boy no less! üòÑ\n\nLike you said at the beginning, I feel like every single person (male, female, anywhere in between) wants to be loved and feel safe. In our society, boys are not safe expressing negative emotions, dominating ones like aggression and anger as well as vulnerable ones such as sadness or fear. Boys (and girls!) are going to feel angry. They're going to feel sad. If we tell them, You can't feel that here! How can they ever feel safe or loved? How can they even learn to work throoough those feelings? So, I feel like a huge thing to teach a boy, along with consent and all of that, is how to deal with his own emotions in a positive way that will actually help him continue forward without hurting others or himself. When a human being isn't able to get his or her emotional needs met simply by communicating them, they will switch to manipulation. Men, on average, can become dominant, overbearing, aggressive, and even violent; women, on average, can become passive aggressive, backstab-y, naggy, play dumb or weak to get their needs met as well. Of course, from the outside this is obviously not the healthy way to do it!\n\nI just wanted to share that if we could teach children how to express and work through their own negative emotions, and in turn teach them empathy for others' feelings and vulnerabilities, maaaany problems would be solved even before they began.",0,0

WFb0EDl-JS8,"Thank you for bring this up. As a jewish feminist I wanted to bring two things up. We all need to be shocked and do something about this behaviour. If you know someone is doing something like this it is YOUR job to go to the police and child services to report it. It isn't right to stand by and know this is going on and not do anything about it ourselves. The second point is about addressing all those beliefs we have about women. We shouldn't dress a certain way or we are asking for it, we shouldn't go out alone because we are vulnerable as women.... Men need to be and are responsible for their own behaviour. It's up to us teach our sons that these beliefs are wrong. Just some of the beliefs about men are wrong. No Mayim, not all men want one thing. It's an important lesson for everyone to learn.

6eHExt8C0qw,Hey look. It's a comic book fan talking to two-non-comic book fans.\n*Non-comic fans:* Pfft? Really?\n*Comic fan:* Yes. Really.,86,1
6eHExt8C0qw,"Why is this trailer so dramatic? It's a film about how a guy got inspired by his sexual relationship with two women and wrote a fetish fiction about a female superhero. It isn't inception, it's an art film that's trying to say something different about society's treatment of woman in positions of power, ironically choosing the one heroine who's kryptonite is men with whips. At least the concept is original, but I'm not completely sure what this movie is actually trying to say, if anything. Obviously a film doesn't need a message to drill into the viewers head as it can just tell a story, but now of all times? When the feminist movement is being popularized and slandered by the internet? Perhaps it's banking on the popularity of the previous Wonder Woman film, which itself is trying to bank on the feminist movement. (It wasn't even a good movie when being set to the standards of Homecoming and the Batman trilogy, at least to my personal preference.) Either way this won't change the way I look at Wonder Woman. The character has made a social impact sure, but not to the extent of Batman, Spiderman, or hell, even Deadpool. I reason this because she is exactly what she is, a superhero. Except she doesn't stand out or have something she does that seperates her from the especially large crowd of heroes. Spider-Man has to find a way to survive villains he used to know as friends, while balancing his home life and super life. He's just a kid. Batman is a tormented man who's past haunts him, so instead of moping he makes something of himself. He's just sad. Relatable characters. The only relatable thing about Wonder Woman is that she a woman. And that's what her market is based on. Sure she can battle Superman or some villain, and it'd look dope. She's just not an interesting enough character to be intested in. What is her weakness? What keeps her down everyday, just for her to overcome it? Being a woman. I can sure relate to that. Me myself can breath. I was born with it and many don't actually care if I do or don't, but now it's got me chained down. Not relatable. So why is this trailer glorifying the birth of this character? Sales most likely. Or the idea is simply artistic? It doesn't say anything, but it's never been put on screen before. And really at the end of the day, originality is what artists strive for. Thanks Wonder Woman.",43,5

This screwed me up just as much as the sexual abuse forced on me by men! It is a psychological sexual abuse rather than a physical one, but just as damaging! I hated myself because I was male, and tried until I was 36 to be a sexless woman so my extended family would love me!\n\nI've learned through 20+ years of healing, that most men would NEVER intentionally hurt anyone with their sexuality! It took looking at people's behavior more objectively and comparing it to my conditioning and finding that more often, men were just as likely as women to be loving and kind and nurturing. It took me a long time to believe that truth! I also found that women were just as likely to abuse themselves and the men and children in their lives, but most people don't see that because it usually looks different than when men do it. \n\nI hear a lot of things in your words that show you believe everyone should be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their sex or gender or ethnicity or culture. I also hear a fear of men's sexuality more than women's. I know that women get aroused and think of sex in some form as much as men, but our society has come to celebrate women expressing their sexuality and condemning men's. This is abhorrent! It teaches men (and boys) to be ashamed of themselves for having normal feelings and having their bodies react to those feelings. It forces them to explore their sexuality in secret, and in ways that will hurt them on at least some level. It won't turn them into rapists, because most men (boys) don't feel that way about others, but it will hurt them.\n\nSociety, and most of the individuals that make it up, expect men (boys) to always protect others. They ignore it when men (boys) need that protection from others. It is unrealistic to expect men (boys) to always be protectors, and when we fail at it for whatever reason, it ruins who we are. It forces women into victim roles more often, because they are taught that they are helpless without the protection of men! Most women are far from helpless! It is women's responsibility to protect others from abuse just as much as men! It is women's responsibility to get consent for touch just as much as men! You did say that a mother should respect her child's desire to be touched or not, which is unusual, and thrills me! But a great deal of what you said places responsibility on men for keeping their sexuality out of everyday life when they interact with others but never addresses women's responsibility for the same. I suspect this is because you are talking about the abuses by a specific man who just lost his power. I suspect in your everyday life, as situations occur, you treat your kids with love and respect. I hope you, and more so anyone who reads this, considers their boys and girls sexuality, and feelings in general, as equal in value, and deserving of expression without guilt or shame!",1,0

WFb0EDl-JS8,I dunno. ¬†You basically say all porn is abusive. ¬†But there are people who write porn. Nobody's being abused in that creative outlet. And you say strip clubs are bad. Some people feel powerful taking off their clothes. I think your conservatism is making you talk about things you know little to nothing about.,1,0
WFb0EDl-JS8,"I'm sure this is not the same way as it is for many other people, but for me ingesting pornography is either doing little or doing a lot of good for my relationship with women.\n\nI think the most important thing to understand about pornography is that it isn't real. The situations are oversexualized, the body types are oversexualized, and the people involved are experienced. If you want to have a relationship with a real girl, you have to accept that they might be uglier on the outside than the girls in pornography, they might be more shy or more uncomfortable with the prospect of sex than the girls in pornography, and they might either be too inexperienced for you or be experienced to the point of not feeling much from you.\n\nHowever, though this can lead some people who don't think about the constructed nature of porn down a road of sexual deviancy, I believe that it also can stop people from taking drastic measures to deal with their sexual urges. If I didn't have pornography to relieve myself, I don't know what would happen. Would I be the same? Would I try to force relationships with women who aren't ready or even rape someone? Would I end up like the guy who started a school shooting because he believed girls should be attracted to him and that life was unfair? \n\nIs it the same in the opposite direction? Would I feel little to no libido as I gradually adjust to not having sex and not relieving myself? Would this hurt my relationships with women in the opposite direction, if she was ready and I was not?\n\nI believe that if pornography was a purely negative thing it would probably get pushed to the dark web, restricted by governments by some form of legal measures. If you are worried that your sons will learn the wrong message from it, just teach them not to misunderstand or abuse it.",0,0

WFb0EDl-JS8,"Your video is exactly why there is a rape hysteria culture on college campuses. We raised our sons to be respectful etc.  The problem is that there are young women out there who feel they can destroy young mens' lives on a whim and file Title IX sexual misconduct complaints with their universities.  Since the 2011 and 2014 Dear Colleague Letters, hundreds of young mens' lives have been intentionally destroyed by young women who file false complaints against the young men.  Why?  Well, because they had sex with someone behind their boyfriends backand then told their boyfriend that they were raped.  Or, because the girl is jealous that a guy is dating this person instead of her.  Or, because the guy did something non-sexual related to her (eg his suggestion outshone hers.  Or.......if you can think of it, it has been alledged against college males.  College males whose college careers are destroyed because there are ZERO universities out there who want anything other than to report numbers to the Department of Education.  Public and private universities don't give the accused due process.  They don't give those innocent sons any help. Sons lose their scholarships, proceedings extend through school years and break the souls of these young men.  At least one committed suicide because of a false allegation.  Many others have been suspended for semesters/years from colleges, with a larger number being expelled from college.  Their transcripts are marked.  No other colleges will take them.  They fall into dispair, with their parents doing everything to try to save them, save some part of their future, hire attorneys (if they can afford them), to fight the college.  Those with money have been filing cases in federal district courts, where Article III judges (real judges vs the kangaroo courts of colleges) have been ruling in the accused favor, particularly after the young women admits on the stand that she lied about the whole thing.  You put up a video re how to raise young men.  You need to put up a video for those with daughters and tell them that they have a responsibility to be truthful and honest and not make false allegations.  \nNow, there have been and probably always be, unfortunately, cases of actual rape and assault.  In cases of any kind of sexual assault, those cases must no longer be handled by campus police, where evidence is lost, text messages are disregarded, and Title IX staff are inept (along with Deans of Students) to handle actual criminal violations.  And, unbelievably, where actual police and the criminal justice mechanism HAS been used and has found the young men not guilty or not enough evidence, universities STILL have been going forward with kicking the young men out of colleges.  \nHonesty, fairness, due process is for EVERYONE.  It is not logical to always believe the accuser.  If you do that, the accused then becomes a victim.  If you think that way, then you believe that everyone is guilty until proven innocent.  This is not the basis of what our country stands for.

One more thing, as we have learned from the Weinstein chronicles , as I call them, some people were extremely vocal about saying no and that they aren't comfortable while others weren't, this leads to a problem because we are not yet equipped to read people's minds. For example, an actress/actor may be willing (though not excited) to have a relationship with a director thinking they'll get a great role and then once that role falls through suddenly they believe they were taken advantage of and so on- consent isn't an easy subject because it can be given initially just to be rescinded post factum which makes the situation hard to prove.

WFb0EDl-JS8,"Mayim, I love this video and the message you try to convey in it. However, I believe that many of the choices in regards to diction in this video come from a place of ignorance, thus unfortunately harming your message. The issues of sexual violence are not inherently patriarchal. Biological women are just as likely as biological men to experience strong levels of sexual attraction. Yes, those with higher levels of testosterone (i.e. biosex males) have a tendency to be more aggressive, but the approach taken in this video that boys in particular are likely to grow up to become sexually aggressive is a bit problematic for a few reasons:\n\n-It dismisses the equal likelihood of women to experience strong sex drives, invalidating female sexual expression\n\n-It assumes that all men experience sexual attraction, excluding the many people of all genders who are asexual or sex-repulsed.\n\n-It asserts that women and girls are the victims of rape, assault, and abuse, dismissing the experiences of male, intersex, and nonbinary victims\n\n\nI thoroughly appreciate your being so brave and caring as to make this video and convey such an important message. That being said, some of these small mistakes seem to have been off-putting to many, preventing them from being perceptive to the responsible, constructive, and positive message of this video. Though I know you mean no harm, of course, many others may not. Subsequently, it‚Äôs important to keep in mind that no one shares the exact same experiences or knowledge.

WFb0EDl-JS8,"I think the main problem here is that women just don't understand what sexuality is like for men. It seems as though many women believe that they're normal and men aren't. It isn't something men can control, it's a biological NEED that that our bodies create to ensure that our genes are spread, it's not something we can control. Think about it, women can get sex virtually whenever they want, they don't even really have to be pretty, this leaves them satisfied and happy, however it is NOT the same for guys, so when men who are REALLY sexually charged can't have sex, it often leaves them sexually frustrated and angry, leading to rapists and creeps. I'm not saying rapists are justified or that men are owed sex, I'm just saying that instead of alienating these men and treating them like freaks, we should try to help them cope in different ways, and women need to remember that it takes a lot for men to control themselves sometimes, so try to be empathetic.",0,0
WFb0EDl-JS8,"You made a great video. I like the way you think. I'm with you. I just want to interject a distinction on your blanket use of patriarchy. The way I heard it in this video is: All patriarchy is bad and will only end in male power crushing women and underrepresented minority groups under its heel. That's not a quote, obviously. But by not defining what you mean by patriarchy, you imply that patriarchy by its design will only lead to bad or is something to be thwarted by society. I really think it would be more helpful in the long run for people to understand that there is a big difference between the Wise King and the Tyrannical Father, which are the positive and/or negative sides of the male archetype. Just as there is a big difference between the Queen/Mother and a Cruel and Distant Mother who eats her young. There is good and bad in both patriarchy and matriarchy. I hope we are not confusing general audiences with a simplistic social idea and movement that all patriarchy is bad and all matriarchy is good.

WFb0EDl-JS8,"Mayim, I think it's unfair to say that men are solely motivated by sex. The female equivalent would be to say that women are solely motivated by wealth and security. And that simply isn't true. Our human minds are nuanced by our nature, but can very easily (in many aspects) be overridden by our education. Also, as a woman who was sexually abused by another woman as a child, while statistics do show that men are more likely to perpetrate these crimes, it's important to stop portraying all men as only potential perpetrators, and all women as only potential victims. The things we teach our boys should be the same as the things we teach our girls (and vice versa). This ideology is harmful to both men and women alike, and is currently one of the motivating forces driving people away from the feminist movement. I genuinely believe that this specific way of thinking needs to be revised for feminism to move forward into the future.",1,1

Perfect! during the trailer and while Jody and the crew was talking was a bit irritating at times. Just my honest opinion.\n\n*2) Luke Dipped:* From what it seemed like to me, Luke was talking to Rey. He saw the power of her Force, similar to Kylo's, which is why he said that when he witnessed this raw strength the first time, he wasn't afraid, but that now he was.\n\n*3) Leia:* The only part of this trailer that came close to making me feel anything was seeing Carrie Fisher on that spacecraft and Kylo with his finger on the trigger. Out of all ways for General Leia to die, it's gotta be by this weak Kylo's hand? Not to mention her son, too - this nigga be offin' his pops and his mother.

6eHExt8C0qw,"Why is this trailer so dramatic? It's a film about how a guy got inspired by his sexual relationship with two women and wrote a fetish fiction about a female superhero. It isn't inception, it's an art film that's trying to say something different about society's treatment of woman in positions of power, ironically choosing the one heroine who's kryptonite is men with whips. At least the concept is original, but I'm not completely sure what this movie is actually trying to say, if anything. Obviously a film doesn't need a message to drill into the viewers head as it can just tell a story, but now of all times? When the feminist movement is being popularized and slandered by the internet? Perhaps it's banking on the popularity of the previous Wonder Woman film, which itself is trying to bank on the feminist movement. (It wasn't even a good movie when being set to the standards of Homecoming and the Batman trilogy, at least to my personal preference.) Either way this won't change the way I look at Wonder Woman. The character has made a social impact sure, but not to the extent of Batman, Spiderman, or hell, even Deadpool. I reason this because she is exactly what she is, a superhero. Except she doesn't stand out or have something she does that seperates her from the especially large crowd of heroes. Spider-Man has to find a way to survive villains he used to know as friends, while balancing his home life and super life. He's just a kid. Batman is a tormented man who's past haunts him, so instead of moping he makes something of himself. He's just sad. Relatable characters. The only relatable thing about Wonder Woman is that she a woman. And that's what her market is based on. Sure she can battle Superman or some villain, and it'd look dope. She's just not an interesting enough character to be intested in. What is her weakness? What keeps her down everyday, just for her to overcome it? Being a woman. I can sure relate to that. Me myself can breath. I was born with it and many don't actually care if I do or don't, but now it's got me chained down. Not relatable. So why is this trailer glorifying the birth of this character? Sales most likely. Or the idea is simply artistic? It doesn't say anything, but it's never been put on screen before. And really at the end of the day, originality is what artists strive for. Thanks Wonder Woman.",43,5

The good news is that by having a name true to your heritage you are helping many people learn how to pronounce them. Hopefully one day it wont be a problem for our culture. Also, whiteness is a construct of white supremacy and by using he term you're conforming to racist ideology.

HUgYoT_xEFY,Thank you for your content!,0,0
HUgYoT_xEFY,Great video. You left out a key part of Logan's normal world that shapes the lie he believes. Logan' has lived many many years. Bad things happen to people he cares about because he has lived so long and through so much. He always outlives the people he cares about both because he is virtually indestructible and because of the longevity of his life. His mutant gift is his curse and shapes the way he has viewed the world for a long time. That curse gives depth to his pain beyond the simple statement that bad things happen to those he cares about.,0,0

HUgYoT_xEFY,"I'm not a student of film, but I couldn't watch Logan - it was one of the few films I switched off before it finished. All the emotion seemed so tacky and cliche - please, Logan; do it for the children... And all the swearing and blood just seemed like cheap, desperate attempts to regain an audience that's moved on. The bad guys were unrealistically evil, and not surprisingly arranged into a heartless, tattooed, child-killing muscled paramilitary posse - the perfect characters to have die - and headed by a suave young bad ass leader - there wasn't one thing this movie did which hadn't been done a million times before, including in Children of Men.  \nOver-emotional, unimaginative, and falling over itself to be gritty, it just didn't do it for me at all.\n\nSo yeah, I didn't like it, and don't think it came anywhere near CoM.",0,0

The first pregnant woman in 18 years is the circumstances of the world changing, before her what he believed was true. \n\n2.) Logan the movie never proved that the lie Logan the character believed to be false. At the end of the movie, two of the 3 people in his life die, and one is on the run from people who are hunting her. Even the nice family he stayed with on the farm all die. Shitty stuff happened to the people he let into his life. If anything, the movie proves him right. \n\n3.)

WFb0EDl-JS8,"I want  ask this question, I had  an incident when 16 I was at a concert and in a big crowd such as that I made my way up close to the barrier there was this young ladies between 14 to 16 the crowd started to push and lean towards the barrier I got pushed up straight to her,, my privates pressing up against her backside this happened the guts of 8 to 10 times and as unintentionally tried to stop it then I got a look of uncomfortable as she turned her head slightly to look back and I said sorry then I tried to turn my hips that if had to happen it was not my crot√ßh hitting in her ass,  I tried to solve the situation but I didn't think there was a problem until I got her acknowledgement with the look that she gave you describe it fear but I never meant to make her feel that way but it could of been worst the guy behind me was leaning and pressing up against me and hanging over my back what if he was the one pressing up against her would he have taught that this girl is feeling uncomfortable because i having my body pressed up against her probably not, alcohol impact drastically on your taught process thank God I was not drinking and to that girl were ever you are sorry from the bottom of my heart oh and from a different aspect men can be victims I worked as security in functions and events in pubs and night clubs and even in diners and on many occasions I got my ass slapped,  grabbed and pinched telling that I would love to fuck and in those situations I tried to ignore it and hope it would go a way but that is not how to deal with the situation.",0,0

Talk about misleading signals. Bitches always blame the man for being a man. Where's the tolerance? Testostrone makes us more aggressive, confident, competitive and there's nothing we do about it. Just like women can't do anything about hormonal embalances around PMS. Bitches want all the tolerance during their menstrual period. But men act like men, they just say no to tolerance. Fuck women they, are stupid cunts!",0,0
WFb0EDl-JS8,"One important thing about how boys and girls learn to respect the opposite sex, from young age is by example in the home. If the family unit is dysfunctional (which in today's society very few are growing up in a non-dysfunctional family), no matter the amount of learning a kid gets, most will grow up and be just like their parents with some that will not fall in to the same cycle (good or bad), but many will. The irony is that the traditional two parent family is looked at as some sort of threat and raising a boy to respect a female and be abstinent and for a girl to stay abstinent is like some sort of an alien idea from the stone ages. Yet in general the secular society preaches to be free, careless and do what makes you happy, but when time comes to pay up for that careless way of life, people are looking for a way out without wanting to face consequences for their actions, as in the case of Harvey and many many others that are in the position of power and lots of money or even regular folks. Until people will realize that a society does need rules and boundaries, the whole notion of I can do what I want as long as it makes me happy is just a lie that is backfiring faster then a bullet on Hollywood and the the whole elite and rich people in power. In the end people are desperately in need of God and His gift of salvation as most are hanging of a cliff of death holding on by a string that is about to snap, but yet when someone is offering a solution and a helping hand, many are refusing to grab on to it. Just my two cents. You make a lot of great point Mayim, Blessing to your family.",0,0

WFb0EDl-JS8,This video is great. Well needed.\nBut I do think that what you said in the beginning about most men being sexually motivated needs to be discussed. It is clear that the patriarchy judges a man based on how strong his (hetero-) sexual drive is. And so we cannot play into the patriarchy's hands and say  that men are naturally more libido driven. That is harmful.,0,0

I never thought at anytime to talk to my son. I guess my thought was, your dad is so amazing, he'd never do anything to anyone that would even be close to anything associated with sexual degradation or sexual manipulation! How blind am I. My son learns from us but he's learning from everything around him. I'll be using this as a reminder and as a lesson to use with teaching all my children what they should be following on a daily with themselves and others. Just so you know. You were the first I came to when I had an issue with my 15yr old daughter wanting to hang out with a friend that wasn't a friend 6 months ago.

WFb0EDl-JS8,"I enjoy watching your commentaries,  you are very insightful, but like many women in modern first world societies  much of your view completely disregards the natural laws of biology. Many women today see men as the week, emasculated, effeminate metrosexuals  that popular media wishes to portray men to be. I don't wish to dispute that society is evolving and that many of the truths' we used to hold have changed. But here is one that hasn't, can't and never will. Men (population) are bigger and stronger than women, they have different hormones circulating in the bodies and have different genitalia. No societal construct will ever change the biology of the species, no social engineering will ever allow a 45kg woman to pickup a fallen 115kg man on the battlefield and carry him to safety, no gender diversity directions will give a 45kg woman the upper body and forearm strength to pickup and operate the jaws of life or steel cutter to rescue people trapped in wreckage or building fires. Men and Women are physically different, period. Please, I accept the host of good changes that equal rights bring, but lets stop kidding ourselves and start acknowledging basic biological truth. Men and women are not the same thing, they are men and they are women.",0,0

WFb0EDl-JS8,"This illustrates so much about points where modern-day feminism has completely jumped the shark and simply does not speak to me as a woman.  \n\nFirst, to assume all men are motivated by nothing more than sex is ridiculous.  Look to the men in your life who mean the most to you, and you ought to know that's not true.  At least, not unless all of the men in your life are vapid, one-dimensional characters.  \n\nSecond, are you as a woman not interested in sex?  Because I am, and clearly so many others are. \n\nThird, Harvey Weinstein and his ilk are the exception and not the norm. \n\nFourth, I agreed with most of your bullet points, except those parts about strip clubs and pornography.  I'm assuming you hold those views because you're religious. Otherwise, those are simply forms of entertainment that I'd prefer to educate people on than ban altogether.   \n\nFifth, here's what was missing from your video and is where feminism today is sorely lacking. Sexual freedom means sexual responsibility.  And that means you don't put yourself in certain situations unless you understand the possibilities and consequences.  So many of the women involved in this scandal come off as incredibly stupid... you went up to this man's hotel room alone?  Fucking stupid.  I'm not saying they deserved what they got... a woman should be able to stand buck naked in front of man, and he ought to have enough self-control to not assault her.  However, recognizing that there are evil people out there, why make yourself an easy target?  \n\nAnd do you know why this took so long to come out?  Because so many of these idiotic women were too afraid to report it because they were hoping to get something out of this asshole and his company.  I feel compassion for these women, but until we acknowledge the mistakes they made, rather than see them solely as victims, we are not going to move forward in this.  We need to educate girls and young women about their sexual freedom and the responsibility that comes with it. There is audio from 2015 of a model who was apparently assaulted by Weinstein and who subsequently approached him a second time while wearing a wire.  Everyone, especially women, should listen to that audio.  He sounds desperate and ridiculous, pleading with her and pleading with her.  If that's how he acted with all of those other women, it should have been relatively simple to realize, Oops, I fucked up by coming up to his room alone, tell him to fuck off, and then get the hell out of dodge.",0,0

WFb0EDl-JS8,"I'll tell you what you should be teaching your boys.  Teach them about the way that women will use them as human ATM's, teach them how women will never really love them but pretend to love them for his resources. Teach them that women will lie and use false rape accusations against them when they don't get their way. Teach your boys that women will lie about everything they talk about. Teach them that the local and state and the federal, family courts are fixed to make sure you don't get a fair trial and so that women will most of the time be able to legally rob them of everything they've worked hard for to provide for a thankless, never happy, selfish, self hating, who pretends to love and care about them but has no empathy or love for them. Teach them that women will get angry and violent and hit  and kick  you and throw things at you or try to run you over with their cars and you are not allowed to protect yourself or you will go to jail and the woman won't but she'll be able to live in your house until it becomes hers legally.\n Teach them that a woman will never be happy or content with anything they do even if its exactly what the woman said to do it. Teach them that they will need to find somewhere to go if they get physically abused by a woman because there are no shelters for battered husbands\n If you try to get help from a shelter for battered women, they will tell them they don't serve their kind and will tell them to man up and probably call the cops on you for trespassing or harassment.\n   Teach them that women are equal to men in the sense that they are human, or part human, and that they breath air and they shit and piss other then those things women are not ever going to be eqaul to men in any other way. It's ridiculous to think that is at all possible.  Women are not men and men are not women. Period.  \n   Teach your boys how to spot a gold digging liar. They are the ones with vaginas.\n   Teach them about gynocentricism, and feminists who won't shut the fuck up and who hates men and wants to destroy men's lives worse then they already have. Teach them that men didn't invent or teach other men to hate women and men didn't  create patriarchy, that is something women created to complain about because their lives were made so easy and had too much spare time during the day because of all the modern conveniences that men invented and created for women to make the old household chores simple such as the dishwasher, the clothes washing machine, the dryer the self cleaning oven, the microwave etc... all so she could have time to expand their minds and appreciate and question and learn about the world. But women didn't want to spend their new free time learning or having intellectual conversations the way men do, they want to spend that free time spending their man's money on themselves and sleeping with the Neighbor or her friend from work.\n    That's enough for now\n Remember, ask yourself if you would want any woman to treat your boys the way women treat men? Seriously, think about how much shit women do and get away with because they are women think about how unfairly men are treated. There has been a 20% increase in male suicides since 1960 and a 40% since 1990. Suicide among women has been stable or decreased. More men get abused by their spouses than women 70% goes unreported and of the 30% reported only 2% of that are ever prosecuted and most are never given jail time or even sentenced. \n  Teach your boys the truth and keep them safe from women.  If you are able to have a moment of honest, rational, concern for your boys well being, mental, emotional and physical then you need to be open and honest about women and society in general and how they will be strictly thought of as providers and everyone except them has rights and gets help when needed but only men get nothing for doing everything. Teach them how women are trying to eliminate Father's Day because Fathers aren't important enough to be recognized and appreciated for their hard work and keeping a roof over our heads and food on the table and protection against bad people. \n   Don't forget, teach your boys to be men not femimen or manginas.",0,0

WFb0EDl-JS8,"I'm sure this is not the same way as it is for many other people, but for me ingesting pornography is either doing little or doing a lot of good for my relationship with women.\n\nI think the most important thing to understand about pornography is that it isn't real. The situations are oversexualized, the body types are oversexualized, and the people involved are experienced. If you want to have a relationship with a real girl, you have to accept that they might be uglier on the outside than the girls in pornography, they might be more shy or more uncomfortable with the prospect of sex than the girls in pornography, and they might either be too inexperienced for you or be experienced to the point of not feeling much from you.\n\nHowever, though this can lead some people who don't think about the constructed nature of porn down a road of sexual deviancy, I believe that it also can stop people from taking drastic measures to deal with their sexual urges. If I didn't have pornography to relieve myself, I don't know what would happen. Would I be the same? Would I try to force relationships with women who aren't ready or even rape someone? Would I end up like the guy who started a school shooting because he believed girls should be attracted to him and that life was unfair? \n\nIs it the same in the opposite direction? Would I feel little to no libido as I gradually adjust to not having sex and not relieving myself? Would this hurt my relationships with women in the opposite direction, if she was ready and I was not?\n\nI believe that if pornography was a purely negative thing it would probably get pushed to the dark web, restricted by governments by some form of legal measures. If you are worried that your sons will learn the wrong message from it, just teach them not to misunderstand or abuse it.",0,0

WFb0EDl-JS8,"Your video is exactly why there is a rape hysteria culture on college campuses. We raised our sons to be respectful etc.  The problem is that there are young women out there who feel they can destroy young mens' lives on a whim and file Title IX sexual misconduct complaints with their universities.  Since the 2011 and 2014 Dear Colleague Letters, hundreds of young mens' lives have been intentionally destroyed by young women who file false complaints against the young men.  Why?  Well, because they had sex with someone behind their boyfriends backand then told their boyfriend that they were raped.  Or, because the girl is jealous that a guy is dating this person instead of her.  Or, because the guy did something non-sexual related to her (eg his suggestion outshone hers.  Or.......if you can think of it, it has been alledged against college males.  College males whose college careers are destroyed because there are ZERO universities out there who want anything other than to report numbers to the Department of Education.  Public and private universities don't give the accused due process.  They don't give those innocent sons any help. Sons lose their scholarships, proceedings extend through school years and break the souls of these young men.  At least one committed suicide because of a false allegation.  Many others have been suspended for semesters/years from colleges, with a larger number being expelled from college.  Their transcripts are marked.  No other colleges will take them.  They fall into dispair, with their parents doing everything to try to save them, save some part of their future, hire attorneys (if they can afford them), to fight the college.  Those with money have been filing cases in federal district courts, where Article III judges (real judges vs the kangaroo courts of colleges) have been ruling in the accused favor, particularly after the young women admits on the stand that she lied about the whole thing.  You put up a video re how to raise young men.  You need to put up a video for those with daughters and tell them that they have a responsibility to be truthful and honest and not make false allegations.  \nNow, there have been and probably always be, unfortunately, cases of actual rape and assault.  In cases of any kind of sexual assault, those cases must no longer be handled by campus police, where evidence is lost, text messages are disregarded, and Title IX staff are inept (along with Deans of Students) to handle actual criminal violations.  And, unbelievably, where actual police and the criminal justice mechanism HAS been used and has found the young men not guilty or not enough evidence, universities STILL have been going forward with kicking the young men out of colleges.  \nHonesty, fairness, due process is for EVERYONE.  It is not logical to always believe the accuser.  If you do that, the accused then becomes a victim.  If you think that way, then you believe that everyone is guilty until proven innocent.  This is not the basis of what our country stands for.

WFb0EDl-JS8,"I understand your outrage about the Hollywood institution of exploitation.  I feel the same way about any person or agency of power. I was also taught that men would do anything for sex, first by my father, and members of my mother's extended family, raping me off and on from age 2 to13, and then by a Xian cult religion. From the time I was in puberty, most of the women in my family, and life, treated me like I was about to rape them all the time. This screwed me up just as much as the sexual abuse forced on me by men! It is a psychological sexual abuse rather than a physical one, but just as damaging! I hated myself because I was male, and tried until I was 36 to be a sexless woman so my extended family would love me!\n\nI've learned through 20+ years of healing, that most men would NEVER intentionally hurt anyone with their sexuality! It took looking at people's behavior more objectively and comparing it to my conditioning and finding that more often, men were just as likely as women to be loving and kind and nurturing. It took me a long time to believe that truth! I also found that women were just as likely to abuse themselves and the men and children in their lives, but most people don't see that because it usually looks different than when men do it. \n\nI hear a lot of things in your words that show you believe everyone should be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their sex or gender or ethnicity or culture. I also hear a fear of men's sexuality more than women's. I know that women get aroused and think of sex in some form as much as men, but our society has come to celebrate women expressing their sexuality and condemning men's. This is abhorrent! It teaches men (and boys) to be ashamed of themselves for having normal feelings and having their bodies react to those feelings. It forces them to explore their sexuality in secret, and in ways that will hurt them on at least some level. It won't turn them into rapists, because most men (boys) don't feel that way about others, but it will hurt them.\n\nSociety, and most of the individuals that make it up, expect men (boys) to always protect others. They ignore it when men (boys) need that protection from others. It is unrealistic to expect men (boys) to always be protectors, and when we fail at it for whatever reason, it ruins who we are. It forces women into victim roles more often, because they are taught that they are helpless without the protection of men! Most women are far from helpless! It is women's responsibility to protect others from abuse just as much as men! It is women's responsibility to get consent for touch just as much as men! You did say that a mother should respect her child's desire to be touched or not, which is unusual, and thrills me! But a great deal of what you said places responsibility on men for keeping their sexuality out of everyday life when they interact with others but never addresses women's responsibility for the same. I suspect this is because you are talking about the abuses by a specific man who just lost his power. I suspect in your everyday life, as situations occur, you treat your kids with love and respect. I hope you, and more so anyone who reads this, considers their boys and girls sexuality, and feelings in general, as equal in value, and deserving of expression without guilt or shame!",1,0

And that simply isn't true. Our human minds are nuanced by our nature, but can very easily (in many aspects) be overridden by our education. Also, as a woman who was sexually abused by another woman as a child, while statistics do show that men are more likely to perpetrate these crimes, it's important to stop portraying all men as only potential perpetrators, and all women as only potential victims. The things we teach our boys should be the same as the things we teach our girls (and vice versa). This ideology is harmful to both men and women alike, and is currently one of the motivating forces driving people away from the feminist movement.

She may do whatever she wants, she can NOT decide what HER sons will be like. Plain and simple stupid, because this would mean that Harvey Weinstein's parents, Bill Cosby's parents, Bill O'Reilly's parents, Bill Clinton's parents, Ben Affleck, Donald Trump, Roger Ailes, and the list goes on and on, they all had parents who did something terribly wrong! I call Bull. These persons, as you and I, made their own (wrong) choices.

Perfect! during the trailer and while Jody and the crew was talking was a bit irritating at times. Just my honest opinion.\n\n*2) Luke Dipped:* From what it seemed like to me, Luke was talking to Rey. He saw the power of her Force, similar to Kylo's, which is why he said that when he witnessed this raw strength the first time, he wasn't afraid, but that now he was.\n\n*3) Leia:* The only part of this trailer that came close to making me feel anything was seeing Carrie Fisher on that spacecraft and Kylo with his finger on the trigger. Out of all ways for General Leia to die, it's gotta be by this weak Kylo's hand? Not to mention her son, too - this nigga be offin' his pops and his mother. And even then, he doesn't come across as savage or menacing.",5,1

cqpg9IJ0jbg,"My theory is  we saw kylo struggling to kill his mom, I honestly don't think he will because they would not show it in the trailer. I honestly think kylo is going to go good or at least be in the middle. This trilogy already has a big bad guy and that's snoke. If kylo and snoke were both bad that's honestly very simple storytelling. If Rey and kylo were in a grey area that would really change the whole Star Wars universe.

cqpg9IJ0jbg,"Kylo won't push the trigger and shoot at his mother. Look closely at his facial expressions in that shot. The Force Awakens novel and script both said he immediately regretted killing Han. Snoke had convinced him that he had to kill Han to reach his potential, but he felt weakened instead. Plus the director of this movie said that Leia's story arc will be very satisfying. How would that be if her son kills her? Even though Kylo is speaking about killing the past during that shot, I think that's a later conversation Kylo is having with Rey.",0,0
cqpg9IJ0jbg,"I think Luke was talking about Kylo ren when he was talking about the raw power, he didn't fear/ respect it so kylo became a loose cannon, he probably could've trained him better. Now that he sees Rey, another person with a lot of power, he fears/respects it tremendously because of what kylo ren did (killed the other students and joined Snoke).

Since I am character centraled writer, I'm looking back on my product and seeing the glaring flaws in my book AND the potentialfor it to be better. \n\nThanks to this video, now I have a better idea of how to handle my protagonist's character arc. The fact that the lie she believes in is too easily debunked early in the book, and now I am seeking ways to get that lie to hold her back even further than before so I can make a more compelling narrative.\n\nTHANK YOU, Michaeal, for everything you do on this channel.

Bad things happen to people he cares about because he has lived so long and through so much. He always outlives the people he cares about both because he is virtually indestructible and because of the longevity of his life. His mutant gift is his curse and shapes the way he has viewed the world for a long time. That curse gives depth to his pain beyond the simple statement that bad things happen to those he cares about.,0,0

But I have a feeling that voices of victims are disappearing in the flood of scandals that too often include opportunists. Abuse has become profitable hysteria. \nAnd what a question! To assume that someone is in danger to become abuser, just because he is a boy?  How would media react to the question that someone is in danger to become gold digger just because she is a girl? Right now the later is not in fashion, but what if it becomes the next profitable hysteria? What will happen to victims of abuse then? \nPeople are people. It is not their identity that defines them, it is their character. \nIf you are abused, report it. Remove yourself form abuser presence. I do not appreciate thanking them when it suits you and then accusing then when it becomes profitable. I do not know what to believe since we are living in times when practically everybody wants their 5 minutes of fame.  I do not know what to think of it, but I am worried for the future. \nI do agree that it is important to raise children to be good people, but also smart and recognize bad people and to protect themselves.

WFb0EDl-JS8,"You sure this isn't just a slow news day in Hollywood/MSM, Mayim? To me, Harvey Weinstein is neither beast nor beauty; he is a man in an industry that does a lot of social climbing over bodies to succeed where the first rule of fight club is: LOOK AT ME NO MATTER WHAT--oh was I lying? *sorry* Got your attention though, didn't I?\n\nLogic is not always necessary; neither is talent or merit. Sometimes ruthless, status seeking sorts end up on top, no matter what people tell you how it's SUPPOSED to work. In real life, a LOT of businesses in our surface-as-deep culture behave like this. I'm living in it; I know this truth to be self-evident. Why would I be shocked?\n\nAnd I imagine Weinstein will WIN in some way, whether people fob him off or not. Good or bad, it's all publicity!\n\nAnd another thing: Harvey didn't start the fire. But a lotta liberals seem to have tied their trucks to Harvey and are seeing how much MILEAGE they can get out of this. Crap!\n\nThe first thing I thought when I heard about this was: 1. Is Harvey being hassled about a business deal he may be winning in some way, and this is how someone reacted to him by pulling a scandal out of their back pocket? 2. Is Harvey Weinstein no longer pulling in the numbers and someone saw him as an easy target; a target, in fact, to add to the 'to do list/watch me' list of a lot of the Hollywood liberals who seek to stay in power in some way. *sigh*\n\nSo much drama. My heart.\n\nI was reading a newspaper and noticed more 'actresses' were coming to the microphone to speak. Being as I've dealt with this, with Trump and way back, Bill Clinton, and now this whole illiberal thing, (sorry, I have issues with anyone being irrational about anything and a lot of liberals are doing that, right this minute) something occurred to me:\n\nAre these actors AUDITIONING for jobs here? I don't mean Mayim. I mean the actors in Hollywood seeking some kind of status.\n\nCreating scandal and then jumping on the marketing cycle. Hm\n\nGo Mayim. I agree with what you're saying here. Even the behaviour on the part of people being harassed by Bill Clinton? I'm sorry: you OPEN YOUR MOUTH AND SAY SOMETHING. Right then; at the time. Have you so little self-respect? Is this what your party is teaching you? Shame on you.\n\nTo HELL with a job. You have to LIVE with yourself.\n\nroo3story",0,0

WFb0EDl-JS8,"Women covered from head to toe are raped. Most rapes happen at home. Most rape victims were clothed modestly. Most women are sexually assaulted at their job or in education. My bestfriend, a modest looking young woman with many acne in her face, was sexually assaulted two times in college. \nClothes don't make people look or be modest. Clothes do NOT protect women and girls from rape and sexual assault. Instead of telling women what to wear and what not, we need to teach men and boys NOT to rape and NOT to sexually assault people.\nYour article was ignorant and stupid at this one point, when you said women should make wise choices. So women should stay at home, like in a prison, and not marry, so to avoid rape and sexual assault? Why punishing the innocent? Shouldn't creeps like weinstein stay looked up? Shouldn't men as sick as him stay at home, so that they don't sexually assault?\nYour article does imply another thing: that men are animals who just can't control their dick. But there is this fact: Rape is a choice. Sexual assault is a choice.*Some* men do it because they know they probably will get away with it, just like the >96 of rapists who will never be jailed for their barbaric crime, often due to lack of proof.\nSexual assault. Why does it happen? Because of some utterly mindsick man. Not because the woman choose to wear a short skirt, not because she goes to college, or because she is working.

I believe that the nurturing of any child, through the phases of childhood and adolescence almost always results in thoughtful, self aware individuals who although certainly not perfect, will have a degree of common sense and empathy for others. And that can only be a good thing for all of us ultimately.\n\nYour focus is your boys understandably but I do feel it's important for us to recognise that the victim and the perpetrator in these sorts of situations is not always immediately evident and not always mutually exclusive. Harvey Weinstein has behaved reprehensibly that's without question. But what about all those who have been complicit in keeping this all under the carpet for so long, both men and women. For me they are just as if not more guilty. As this story has broken I've seen high profile actresses come forward, some from very established Hollywood dynasties and arguably with a good deal of power behind them. They have been content for years in benefiting through his projects even after the alleged transgressions and now decide to jump on the proverbial band wagon. It's all very self serving as far as I'm concerned. \n\nI think as a society we can be quite unfair to boys and men sometimes. Most men I know are decent and not slaves to their sexual urges. By the same token, there are women who use their sexuality in a very calculated way to suit their agenda. I don't disagree with you but I do think as parents we need to teach our daughters as well as our sons to behave with integrity in all things including sex and intimacy.",0,0

WFb0EDl-JS8,"One important thing about how boys and girls learn to respect the opposite sex, from young age is by example in the home. If the family unit is dysfunctional (which in today's society very few are growing up in a non-dysfunctional family), no matter the amount of learning a kid gets, most will grow up and be just like their parents with some that will not fall in to the same cycle (good or bad), but many will. The irony is that the traditional two parent family is looked at as some sort of threat and raising a boy to respect a female and be abstinent and for a girl to stay abstinent is like some sort of an alien idea from the stone ages. Yet in general the secular society preaches to be free, careless and do what makes you happy, but when time comes to pay up for that careless way of life, people are looking for a way out without wanting to face consequences for their actions, as in the case of Harvey and many many others that are in the position of power and lots of money or even regular folks. Until people will realize that a society does need rules and boundaries, the whole notion of I can do what I want as long as it makes me happy is just a lie that is backfiring faster then a bullet on Hollywood and the the whole elite and rich people in power. In the end people are desperately in need of God and His gift of salvation as most are hanging of a cliff of death holding on by a string that is about to snap, but yet when someone is offering a solution and a helping hand, many are refusing to grab on to it.

I don't wish to dispute that society is evolving and that many of the truths' we used to hold have changed. But here is one that hasn't, can't and never will. Men (population) are bigger and stronger than women, they have different hormones circulating in the bodies and have different genitalia. No societal construct will ever change the biology of the species, no social engineering will ever allow a 45kg woman to pickup a fallen 115kg man on the battlefield and carry him to safety, no gender diversity directions will give a 45kg woman the upper body and forearm strength to pickup and operate the jaws of life or steel cutter to rescue people trapped in wreckage or building fires.

WFb0EDl-JS8,"I'll tell you what you should be teaching your boys.  Teach them about the way that women will use them as human ATM's, teach them how women will never really love them but pretend to love them for his resources. Teach them that women will lie and use false rape accusations against them when they don't get their way. Teach your boys that women will lie about everything they talk about. Teach them that the local and state and the federal, family courts are fixed to make sure you don't get a fair trial and so that women will most of the time be able to legally rob them of everything they've worked hard for to provide for a thankless, never happy, selfish, self hating, who pretends to love and care about them but has no empathy or love for them. Teach them that women will get angry and violent and hit  and kick  you and throw things at you or try to run you over with their cars and you are not allowed to protect yourself or you will go to jail and the woman won't but she'll be able to live in your house until it becomes hers legally.\n Teach them that a woman will never be happy or content with anything they do even if its exactly what the woman said to do it. Teach them that they will need to find somewhere to go if they get physically abused by a woman because there are no shelters for battered husbands\n If you try to get help from a shelter for battered women, they will tell them they don't serve their kind and will tell them to man up and probably call the cops on you for trespassing or harassment.\n   Teach them that women are equal to men in the sense that they are human, or part human, and that they breath air and they shit and piss other then those things women are not ever going to be eqaul to men in any other way. It's ridiculous to think that is at all possible.  Women are not men and men are not women. Period.  \n   Teach your boys how to spot a gold digging liar. They are the ones with vaginas.\n   Teach them about gynocentricism, and feminists who won't shut the fuck up and who hates men and wants to destroy men's lives worse then they already have. Teach them that men didn't invent or teach other men to hate women and men didn't  create patriarchy, that is something women created to complain about because their lives were made so easy and had too much spare time during the day because of all the modern conveniences that men invented and created for women to make the old household chores simple such as the dishwasher, the clothes washing machine, the dryer the self cleaning oven, the microwave etc... all so she could have time to expand their minds and appreciate and question and learn about the world. But women didn't want to spend their new free time learning or having intellectual conversations the way men do, they want to spend that free time spending their man's money on themselves and sleeping with the Neighbor or her friend from work.\n    That's enough for now\n Remember, ask yourself if you would want any woman to treat your boys the way women treat men? Seriously, think about how much shit women do and get away with because they are women think about how unfairly men are treated. There has been a 20% increase in male suicides since 1960 and a 40% since 1990. Suicide among women has been stable or decreased. More men get abused by their spouses than women 70% goes unreported and of the 30% reported only 2% of that are ever prosecuted and most are never given jail time or even sentenced. \n  Teach your boys the truth and keep them safe from women.  If you are able to have a moment of honest, rational, concern for your boys well being, mental, emotional and physical then you need to be open and honest about women and society in general and how they will be strictly thought of as providers and everyone except them has rights and gets help when needed but only men get nothing for doing everything. Teach them how women are trying to eliminate Father's Day because Fathers aren't important enough to be recognized and appreciated for their hard work and keeping a roof over our heads and food on the table and protection against bad people. \n   Don't forget, teach your boys to be men not femimen or manginas.",0,0

As a woman who has faced sexual harassment many times from the man who's position is above me I completely know that it becomes something we have come to expect. I've been told things like you're just his type, maybe you should wear turtlenecks all year and you're just being sensitive and sadly that came mostly from women in power next to the perpetrator. Even a close male family member made a comment about what I wear as an excuse for the worst harassment I've faced. (Referencing my blouses, that were all completely covered) \n\nI've also seen women do the same. \n\nAs women we must own our complacency and fear to standing up for both ourselves and others. If I could go back I would have responded loudly with both feet on the ground both to the perpetrator as well as to the women who made excuses and didn't help me stand up for my rights.",0,0

WFb0EDl-JS8,"The truth is that it will be difficult to raise a Harvey Weinstein, because most people never reach such a uniquely powerful and universally respected position. The few people who do must be responsible human beings. If they are not, abuse can be terrible and go on for a long time because our culture teaches that people with such status should not be challenged. \nTake this example of a (female) Navy captain (Capt Graf):\n\nIt was verbal abuse after verbal abuse, you lose complete confidence, a female officer said, adding that she regarded her captain as a terrible role model for women and a terrible representative of the Navy. Investigators were told that Capt Graf repeatedly called her senior staff idiots and told one officer on the bridge: Take your God-damned attitude and shove it up your ass and leave it there. She was said to have told a male officer: The only words I want to hear out of your mouth are 'Yes ma'am' and 'You're correct Ma'am'.",1,0

hkA2a4_tNOs,"The Emojo Movie is illegal - then continues to state reasons and examples why ALL movies are by definition 'illegal'... and then, mention a reason why it's not illegal - (not clickbait, huh?)\n\nThen go on to make your final point, that it's unfair that movies aren't judged by the same criteria as other media when it comes to advertising. I mean, I've hung around despite all the hate to this channel because I enjoy the content, but this video really took the biscuit for me.\n\nFirstly, I would HATE IT if any/all movies took me out of the moment of a film to display a 'sponsored by' tag. And secondly, a huge majority of audiences are probably aware of the issues around sponsored advertising in movies. Any time a branded company comes up, it's kinda guaranteed it's a paid promotion, with no need for clarity - but as you mentioned yourself, if you didn't specify the lack of sponsorship around Diet Coke, then we would assume a similar thing, because we expect that everything is in place for a reason, and product placement is in place for advertising...\n\nCould the practice be cleaned up? Yeah, of course... but instead of making a video about information that's completely nullified at the end (and pretty obvious too, I mean of course it's no illegal, because all movies do exactly the same thing), then what you should have done is state at the beginning 'no, the movie is not illegal because of this, this and this' and then spend the rest of the video explaining why this isn't fair and what solutions could fix this seeming disparity.\n\nBut of course, doing that would make this video title pretty clickbaity - something that's frowned upon on this website, the same way that camping is frowned upon in gaming circles, despite them both being valid but equally 'unfair' ways of gaining an advantage over competitors...",0,0

Because nothing about the movie was illegal.. since you know, FCC doesn't care if movies disclose or not..\nand be real the story and message of the movie wasn't bad, people just got oversensitive that the movie looked like an advertisement.. it's a movie about emojis inside a smartphone, what did you expect to appear in it? Call of Duty Advanced Warfare and World of Warcraft maybe? MAYBE Call of Duty since they actually have an app on iOS and Android, but the only other thing they could've done is make a plot around fake apps, and by then a lot of people might've been fairly confused.\nIt was easier to include apps that people already know, that people are already familiar with. It's supposed to represent our real world and what might be going on in our phones when things get screwy with them. Even if they were paid for every single one of those product integrations for the storyline, they weren't really as invasive as people made them out to be.\nThe first thing you SEE on a smart phone when you unlock it, are of course your apps that you have on the main screen.. Makes sense for them to place it on their main screens too.  I would've actually been disappointed if they didn't use some of the apps in the movie for story just to portray to us how the smartphone runs them in their own sense..\nI want you to picture the movie, if it didn't have the apps in them at all, or fake apps that no one's ever heard of before.

I was dressed in my school uniform which consisted of trousers, a shirt and tie and a blazer, oh and a jacket because it was cold that day. I had my hair in a low pony tail and my glasses on. I wasn't wearing makeup or perfume because I wasn't interested in those things and my parents didn't let me wear them. A man approached me. An older man wearing a long coat. I tried to walk past him but he blocked my path. He was very tall. He opened his coat and showed me his penis. I'd never seen a man's penis before. I was very frightened and I knew instantly I was in danger. Luckily, a car horn went off and distracted him. I ran away. I ran faster than I knew I could run. When I got to school I told my teacher what happened. She called the police. \n\nDid I deserved to be harassed? Was it because of how I dressed or how I behaved?

I treat women with the utmost respect but I expect the same in return,  we are just people who should respect each other equally regardless of gender or race.

WFb0EDl-JS8,"Thanks for this, Ms. Bialik. I very much appreciate your message. I would only add that for me it is subtler than 'we are all equal'. In the most important sense yes, we are all equal. But, as you imply in the beginning, men are indeed different (on average) in their behavioral tendencies. Some of these are perhaps to the good, but others require active civilizing. That is the process you are describing in your 7 point plan, but I think it requires a more explicit acknowledgement that there are many (most?) of us who have natural tendencies that require tempering. It makes the process more difficult but more honest and hopefully more effective: the compassion in the statement I know you have these hormonal or psychological urges but here is why they might be destructive and here is how they can be better channeled makes it more effective. I think.\n\nI do believe it is not only possible but necessary to reconcile treating everyone as a respected individual while acknowledging different tendencies in boys and girls. As the dad of a boy and two girls I can tell you that they sure are different from each other, and the boy is different from the girls in different ways. They require slightly different applications of the same civilizing principles of compassion and respect.\n\nWhich leads me to my one quibble with your excellent talk: the identitarian list.  I understand the historical need for support for marginalized individuals. But they are just that: *individuals* who have been marginalized because of some social status or construct. I think there is some point -- perhaps, debatedly, not yet reached, but some point -- at which automatically collecting them in groups, and reciting the religious litany of identity actually harms their individuality more than it supports their struggle. Group think can be the enemy of compassion. Thus Spielberg's red coated girl in Schindler's list, and thus the fact that my son is * very * different from my daughters, but my daughters also have unique gifts and challenges. Automated identity lists can get in the way.\n\nMy own answer to the extremely important question you raise how not to raise children who are monsters has led me, like you, to try to find ways to communicate universal principles and then help manage the unique messiness of applying them to growing souls. (First the entire Talmud on one foot, but then the entire Talmud, as it were . . .)\n\nIn this regard, I think, demonstrating and modeling and discussing the details of compassion and kindness is the best medicine. It acknowledges urges, and it encourages respect and love of individuals.\n\nI really always used to laugh at the BuJews, but I seem to have become one . . . \n\nThank you again. I appreciate you using your visibility so wonderfully and so productively.\n\nMarc",0,0

To me, Harvey Weinstein is neither beast nor beauty; he is a man in an industry that does a lot of social climbing over bodies to succeed where the first rule of fight club is: LOOK AT ME NO MATTER WHAT--oh was I lying? *sorry* Got your attention though, didn't I?\n\nLogic is not always necessary; neither is talent or merit. Sometimes ruthless, status seeking sorts end up on top, no matter what people tell you how it's SUPPOSED to work. In real life, a LOT of businesses in our surface-as-deep culture behave like this. I'm living in it; I know this truth to be self-evident. Why would I be shocked?\n\nAnd I imagine Weinstein will WIN in some way, whether people fob him off or not. Good or bad, it's all publicity!\n\nAnd another thing: Harvey didn't start the fire. But a lotta liberals seem to have tied their trucks to Harvey and are seeing how much MILEAGE they can get out of this. Crap!\n\nThe first thing I thought when I heard about this was: 1. Is Harvey being hassled about a business deal he may be winning in some way, and this is how someone reacted to him by pulling a scandal out of their back pocket? 2. Is Harvey Weinstein no longer pulling in the numbers and someone saw him as an easy target; a target, in fact, to add to the 'to do list/watch me' list of a lot of the Hollywood liberals who seek to stay in power in some way. *sigh*\n\nSo much drama.

My bestfriend, a modest looking young woman with many acne in her face, was sexually assaulted two times in college. \nClothes don't make people look or be modest. Clothes do NOT protect women and girls from rape and sexual assault. Instead of telling women what to wear and what not, we need to teach men and boys NOT to rape and NOT to sexually assault people.\nYour article was ignorant and stupid at this one point, when you said women should make wise choices. So women should stay at home, like in a prison, and not marry, so to avoid rape and sexual assault? Why punishing the innocent? Shouldn't creeps like weinstein stay looked up? Shouldn't men as sick as him stay at home, so that they don't sexually assault?\nYour article does imply another thing: that men are animals who just can't control their dick.

Sexual assault is a choice.*Some* men do it because they know they probably will get away with it, just like the >96 of rapists who will never be jailed for their barbaric crime, often due to lack of proof.\nSexual assault.

It's all very self serving as far as I'm concerned. \n\nI think as a society we can be quite unfair to boys and men sometimes. Most men I know are decent and not slaves to their sexual urges. By the same token, there are women who use their sexuality in a very calculated way to suit their agenda. I don't disagree with you but I do think as parents we need to teach our daughters as well as our sons to behave with integrity in all things including sex and intimacy.",0,0

Talk about misleading signals. Bitches always blame the man for being a man. Where's the tolerance? Testostrone makes us more aggressive, confident, competitive and there's nothing we do about it.

Fuck women they, are stupid cunts!",0,0
WFb0EDl-JS8,"One important thing about how boys and girls learn to respect the opposite sex, from young age is by example in the home. If the family unit is dysfunctional (which in today's society very few are growing up in a non-dysfunctional family), no matter the amount of learning a kid gets, most will grow up and be just like their parents with some that will not fall in to the same cycle (good or bad), but many will. The irony is that the traditional two parent family is looked at as some sort of threat and raising a boy to respect a female and be abstinent and for a girl to stay abstinent is like some sort of an alien idea from the stone ages. Yet in general the secular society preaches to be free, careless and do what makes you happy, but when time comes to pay up for that careless way of life, people are looking for a way out without wanting to face consequences for their actions, as in the case of Harvey and many many others that are in the position of power and lots of money or even regular folks. Until people will realize that a society does need rules and boundaries, the whole notion of I can do what I want as long as it makes me happy is just a lie that is backfiring faster then a bullet on Hollywood and the the whole elite and rich people in power. In the end people are desperately in need of God and His gift of salvation as most are hanging of a cliff of death holding on by a string that is about to snap, but yet when someone is offering a solution and a helping hand, many are refusing to grab on to it. Just my two cents. You make a lot of great point Mayim, Blessing to your family.",0,0

WFb0EDl-JS8,This video is great. Well needed.\nBut I do think that what you said in the beginning about most men being sexually motivated needs to be discussed. It is clear that the patriarchy judges a man based on how strong his (hetero-) sexual drive is. And so we cannot play into the patriarchy's hands and say  that men are naturally more libido driven. That is harmful.,0,0

WFb0EDl-JS8,"I enjoy watching your commentaries,  you are very insightful, but like many women in modern first world societies  much of your view completely disregards the natural laws of biology. Many women today see men as the week, emasculated, effeminate metrosexuals  that popular media wishes to portray men to be. I don't wish to dispute that society is evolving and that many of the truths' we used to hold have changed. But here is one that hasn't, can't and never will. Men (population) are bigger and stronger than women, they have different hormones circulating in the bodies and have different genitalia. No societal construct will ever change the biology of the species, no social engineering will ever allow a 45kg woman to pickup a fallen 115kg man on the battlefield and carry him to safety, no gender diversity directions will give a 45kg woman the upper body and forearm strength to pickup and operate the jaws of life or steel cutter to rescue people trapped in wreckage or building fires.

WFb0EDl-JS8,"Mayim, I refuse to watch this video. So you make money off my watching this video. I just saw via Twitter your comments concerning your friend Harvey Weinstein. I was shocked and disappointed and disturbed by your comments regarding the comments of children and of actresses who have worked hard and had success even though they turned down your friends advances. I couldn't believe my eyes when I read that you said little girls who have and had more traditional pretty faces and soft voices and who were willing got preferential treatment are more likely to be raped. And women who dress according to style trends are also more likely to be raped. Saying that and that you haven't been raped because of the fact you dress conservative and are a good girl is so wrong. You haven't been raped because you were fortunate not to be. Rape has nothing to do with sex or physical appearance it has to do with power and control. I have read other comments why didn't they speak up sooner. Oh they dressed like sluts and agreed to meet him in his hotel room they deserved it. . It is because of comments like these that women don't report it sooner. And because when a woman reports a rape she has to answer questions about what she was wearing, and was she somewhere she shouldn't have been? Was she drinking? Was she drunk? Didn't she know better. Did she ask for it? DID SHE ASK FOR IT. REALLY??? Rape is the only crime that the victim has to prove she wasn't to blame. They would never ask a guy who's house was broken into and robbed. What he (victim) had been wearing? What he (victim) had been doing? If he (victim) was somewhere he shouldn't have been? Was he (victim) drinking? Was he (victim) drunk? Was he (victim) flirting and giving signs he was interested? This is 2017 not 1878 when pureatines ruled everyone's actions. I wish I didn't love Big bang theory. It breaks my heart but Mayims horrible attitude and responsible and justification in saying a woman asked to be raped makes me NOT want to support and watch anything and everything she is connected to as a actress and what I considered a activist for the human treatment of all of God's creatures.",2,0
WFb0EDl-JS8,"I paused this video at 1:09 to make a comment. I've seen and watched many videos from all over YouTube about how unsurprised people (women especially) are about the truth of this situation. Of course most women aren't unsurprised; I don't know any woman who hasn't been harassed in some way. What separates you from the rest of the people who have commented on this subject so far (kudos to your friend who asked the question) is that you've considered more than finger-wagging. It's a real opportunity to think critically about the future for women, and all people, to be treated differently.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow has said this way of¬†treating¬†women ends now,‚Äù but the utter lack of shock speaks much more loudly. The fact that no one is surprised is the problem. I am so glad that people like you are ready, willing and able to stand up, speak up and lead others--your boys included and perhaps especially--to change the way we think about things like this in the future. \n\nIt must be a terrifying thing to know that your child could turn into someone who would treat another person this way. The fear of that didn't make you run away, but inspired you to share your thoughts and feelings. That is what I want to thank you for. I don't agree with everything that you say or believe. If I did, your videos would be less interesting and challenging and enlightening. Nevertheless, I trust in you to do and say what you feel is right and just and best for you and the people that you love. That is why I am and will always be a fan.

The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike the Emoji Movie truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Eggplant's  existential catchphrase What‚Äôs up Hi-5?  which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons.

Since I am character centraled writer, I'm looking back on my product and seeing the glaring flaws in my book AND the potentialfor it to be better. \n\nThanks to this video, now I have a better idea of how to handle my protagonist's character arc. The fact that the lie she believes in is too easily debunked early in the book, and now I am seeking ways to get that lie to hold her back even further than before so I can make a more compelling narrative.\n\nTHANK YOU, Michaeal, for everything you do on this channel.

So you would wait inside the bathrooms untill everyone got out side the school and into the playground. Then we are pretty much free inside a school. The next part is when it's exactly 1:58 we would go down the stairs sneek into the bushes near the place we're they would run and go to our group tents. That was the plan.

With your flimsy, not sound logic we can infer that you need to be blatant about your mention of Sno Caps and whether or not it's sponsored; you're doing well making sure the audience knows you're not sponsored by the Coca~Cola company. Thank you for making my point: YouTube videos aren't movies. Dabs... your core audience is children now? What happened to making sure the tits are real or not? Like the good 'ole days? Huh? Finally, a voice of reason. You're pointing out how bad a show is to your audience that are probably made up of the folks who watches the show. Money is exchanged for a product to appear in a film (again you should know this), this money goes into the budget, which should go into the production. You make an arguable point, the content on the internet (especially YouTube) rides a fine line because one doesn't know whether or not it's sponsored since you and others try to make a community thus blurring the lines between fact and fiction. Are you making films or television shows (FOR THE TV)? No? Then you aren't trying to craft a form of story which would have it's narrative interrupted by stating whether or not it's an advertisement. A system that's rigged against you? You're on the trending tab... you are YouTube's darling, if you ask nicely I bet they'll suck your cock. Oh, you're on government watchlists? This hack sellout gave the Pope a Steam key, PUT HIM ON THE TERROR WATCHLIST. Give me a fucking break.",0,0
hkA2a4_tNOs,I‚Äôm pretty disappointed in this video if you are going to make a video about fully disclosing the truth then maybe you shouldn‚Äôt title a video all about how youtubers are treated unfairly and the movie industry gets to cheat as ‚Äúemoji movie illegal‚Äù that would be closer to clickbait than I would hope this channel would ever get.

bu9e410C__I,"To add on, I'm a little skeptical about the success of The New Mutants movie. I know nothing about the original comic but, if this is going to be an ongoing series (which, judging by the title it seems to be) then I don't see how the franchise will sell when the pilot is horror driven. Now I'm going to go out of my way and mention Harry Potter. The tone of that franchise went from light to dark. We've seen those characters go from innocent to remorseful. We had time to watch those characters grow and develop. When their darkest moments came, we were ready for it. This story however, starts from the darkest of the dark. Are we going to see these already dark characters become even more dark? Will we get any chance to laugh and grow with them? I don't really see how that would work on screen. Maybe The New Mutants franchise is something that isn't meant to be adapted for the screen. -If I'm wrong and the studios are somehow able to pull it off then cudos to them!",0,0

HUgYoT_xEFY,"Hey! that was a pretty analysis. But I do have a small disagreement: Logan's lie. At the beginning of the video I thought it might be a bigger disagreement, but you do address part of it when you talk about the initial attitudes both protagonists have about the future. The thing is: I'm not sure Logan's lie is some aversion towards family in general.... I mean he does go to great lengths in order to take care of Xavier in his very complicated decrepitude. I'd probably say that Logan's lie has to do with where he thinks his family exists and what he should be trying to save. His lie is that his family ties can only exist in the past and that the debt he needs to repay to professor X can be repaid by taking care of him. But the truth is that his debt must be payed forward, that his obligations are towards the future, not the past.",0,0

hkA2a4_tNOs,"Wait!  So does that mean that every time YouTube forces me to watch a commercial, it is illegal?  The YouTuber himself, or herself, doesn't tell me that they are sponsored by that particular product; and I'm certain it is safe to assume the YouTuber is not aware of every commercial that plays on each and every video (especially since those commercials change each time you watch the same video).  Moreover, YouTube videos are constantly interrupted by commercials at the most random times.  These commercials are usually unskipable and can last anywhere from 10 seconds to 10 minutes!\n\nIt's too bad YouTube doesn't have a subscription service that allows you to avoid commercials for a monthly fee.  If they do have one, they do a terrible job advertising it (which in itself sounds highly unethical, if not illegal).\n\nI pity YouTubers.  It genuinely looks like they are taken advantage of by Google and other major corporations.  When YouTubers like Markiplier and Jacksepticeye tell their audiences that they haven't had a single day off in years because they have to keep putting videos up, I am reminded of the lack of labor laws that existed before President Theodore Roosevelt took a stand against corporations.\n\nSince YouTube is an American company, perhaps it is time for the federal government to open an investigation on them.",0,0

And why does the detective say that they are both ''clean in the same scene with the cameras? Why does the colonel say I will not be called a murderer in my own home when it was mark's house? Why does Damien in the first episode say, try not to rob me *blind* again? Why do both the butler and the chef shrug their shoulders to act all innocent when the detective says I dont trust anyone? Is this connected to the scene with the cameras? And right before that, the butler asks the colonel if he and mark were the same age. What does that mean? And how could an entire body just disappear in the end of episode 1? Where did it go? Why was the detective keeping tabs on the colonel? Who is the groundskeeper?

This would also explain why the characters have been at a 2-year community college for 4 years and why all of the characters are so diverse in ethnicity and personality and background, each a part of himself.

Now I'm going to go out of my way and mention Harry Potter. The tone of that franchise went from light to dark. We've seen those characters go from innocent to remorseful. We had time to watch those characters grow and develop. When their darkest moments came, we were ready for it. This story however, starts from the darkest of the dark. Are we going to see these already dark characters become even more dark? Will we get any chance to laugh and grow with them? I don't really see how that would work on screen. Maybe The New Mutants franchise is something that isn't meant to be adapted for the screen. -If I'm wrong and the studios are somehow able to pull it off then cudos to them!",0,0

Regulations are enforceable by law. Guidances are the FCC's INTERPRETATION of the regulations. Guidances are NOT legally enforceable. They are most useful in lawsuits- most juries will misinterpret FCC's guidances as part of their regulations. A good defence lawyer will  shut those thoughts down quickly (And you better believe the Emoji Movie has the money to hire GREAT lawyers). Technically, the emoji movie DID NOT break any regulations... even though they broke virtually ALL the guidances. If it's brought to court, the emoji movie will win that lawsuit, even though it doesn't seem fair and IT TOTALLY SUCKED. FCC has good lawyers backing them, and these lawyers know all this.

bu9e410C__I,"To add on, I'm a little skeptical about the success of The New Mutants movie. I know nothing about the original comic but, if this is going to be an ongoing series (which, judging by the title it seems to be) then I don't see how the franchise will sell when the pilot is horror driven. Now I'm going to go out of my way and mention Harry Potter. The tone of that franchise went from light to dark. We've seen those characters go from innocent to remorseful. We had time to watch those characters grow and develop. When their darkest moments came, we were ready for it. This story however, starts from the darkest of the dark. Are we going to see these already dark characters become even more dark? Will we get any chance to laugh and grow with them? I don't really see how that would work on screen. Maybe The New Mutants franchise is something that isn't meant to be adapted for the screen. -If I'm wrong and the studios are somehow able to pull it off then cudos to them!",0,0
bu9e410C__I,"This isn't a Fox X-Men movie; this is a horror movie-\nI love X-Men through my life and all the mutants, but this doesn't at all look like a Marvel movie; even in this studios terms; I wanted action and drama, but instead it looks like we'll be having nightmares instead. Bravo-\nI'll try to keep an open mind, but I'll see ya when the movie possibly fails the box office-",0,0
